If working on a new machine:

"git clone https://github.com/JacobTyree1/DiagnosticChatbot.git"
cd DiagnosticChatbot
(You should be in .../DiagnosticChatbot)
To test this, type ls and check to see if you have the option to go to DiagnosticChatbot
and diagnostic-chatbot-ui

python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
(You may have to manually go into Scripts, and run the activate script)

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure that there are no anaconda packages on this.

Run the flask app: 
cd DiagnosticChatbot
python app.py

run the ui 
cd diagnostic-chatbot-ui
npm start
