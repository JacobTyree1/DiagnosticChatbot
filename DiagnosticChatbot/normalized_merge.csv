Other sign and symptom of a popliteal artery aneurysm include: Knee pain Lower leg pain Swelling behind the knee Pulsing sensation behind the knee Causes An aneurysm is a ballooning in a weak spot in an artery wall. Many different thing can cause the popliteal artery wall to become weak, including: Clogged artery (atherosclerosis) High blood pressure Wear and tear of the popliteal artery due to repetitive use of the knee joint Weakening of the artery wall Risk factor Popliteal artery aneurysm are rare. They are more common in men than in women. Popiteal artery aneurysm often occur in men with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a swelling of the wall of the body's main artery (aorta). Anyone diagnosed with popliteal artery aneurysm should be screened for AAA.

"Signs and symptom will vary, depending on the severity of the injury, and may include: Pain or tenderness Redness or bruising Limited motion Muscle spasm Swelling Muscle weakness When to see the doctor Mild strain can be treated at home. See a doctor if your symptom worsen despite treatment — especially if your pain becomes intolerable, or you experience numbness or tingling. Causes Acute strain can be caused by one event, such a using poor body mechanic to lift something heavy. Chronic muscle strain can result from repetitive injury when you stress a muscle by doing the same motion over and over. Risk factor Participating in contact sport — such a soccer, football, hockey, boxing and wrestling — can increase your risk of muscle strains. Certain part of the body are more susceptible to strain during participation in certain sports. Examples include: Legs and ankles. Sports that feature quick start and jumping, such a hurdling and basketball, can be particularly tough on the Achilles tendon in your ankle. Hands. Gripping sports, such a gymnastics or golf, can increase your risk of muscle strain in your hands. Elbows. Elbow strain are often caused by throwing sport and racquet sports. Prevention Regular stretching and strengthening exercise for your sport, fitness or work activity, a part of an overall physical conditioning program, can help to minimize your risk of muscle strains. Try to be in shape to play your sport; don't play your sport to get in shape. If you have a physically demanding occupation, regular conditioning can help prevent injuries.

"Signs and symptom will vary, depending on the severity of the greenstick fracture. Mild fracture might be mistaken for sprain or bruises. More-severe greenstick fracture may cause an obvious deformity, accompanied by significant pain and swelling. When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if your child ha persistent pain in an injured limb. Seek immediate medical attention if a child is unable to bear weight or if there is obvious pain, deformity and swelling. Causes Childhood fracture most commonly occur with a fall. Arm fracture are more common than leg fractures, since the common reaction is to throw out your arm to catch yourself when you fall. Risk factor The risk of greenstick fracture is higher in young child because their bone are softer and more flexible than adult bones. In a greenstick fracture, the bone bend and crack instead of breaking into separate pieces. Most greenstick fracture occur in child under age 10.

"Signs and symptom of trachoma usually affect both eye and may include: Mild itching and irritation of the eye and eyelid Eye discharge containing mucus or pu Eyelid swelling Light sensitivity (photophobia) Eye pain Eye redness Vision loss Young child are particularly susceptible to infection. But the disease progress slowly, and the more painful symptom may not emerge until adulthood. The World Health Organization (WHO) ha identified five stage in the development of trachoma: Inflammation — follicular. The early infection ha five or more follicle — small bump that contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell — visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid (conjunctiva). Inflammation — intense. In this stage, your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated, with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid. Eyelid scarring. Repeated infection lead to scarring of the inner eyelid. The scar often appear a white line when examined with magnification. Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in (entropion). In-turned eyelash (trichiasis). The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform, causing your lash to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye (cornea). Corneal clouding (opacity). The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid. Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lash lead to clouding of the cornea. All the sign of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid. Without intervention, a disease process that begin in childhood can continue to advance into adulthood.",1003,Trachoma

"Babies with Rett syndrome usually are born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Most infant with Rett syndrome seem to grow and behave a expected for the first six months. After that, sign and symptom start to appear. The most pronounced change generally occur at 12 to 18 month of age, over a period of week or months. Symptoms and their severity vary greatly from child to child. The main sign and symptom include: Slowed growth. Brain growth slows after birth. Smaller than usual head size (microcephaly) is sometimes the first sign that a child ha Rett syndrome. As child get older, there is delayed growth in other part of the body. Loss of movement and coordination abilities. The first sign often include reduced hand control and a decreasing ability to crawl or walk. At first, this loss of ability occurs rapidly, and then it continues more gradually. Eventually muscle become weak or stiff, with unusual movement and positioning. Loss of communication abilities. Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak, to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways. They may become disinterested in other people, toy and their surroundings. Some child have rapid changes, such a a sudden loss of language. Over time, child may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills. Unusual hand movements. Children with Rett syndrome usually develop repetitive, purposeless hand movements, which differ from child to child. Hand movement may include hand-wringing, squeezing, clapping, tapping or rubbing. Other sign and symptom can include: Unusual eye movements. Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements, such a intense staring, blinking, crossed eye or closing one eye at a time. Breathing problems. These include breath holding, rapid breathing (hyperventilation), forcefully blowing out air or saliva, and swallowing air. These problem tend to occur during waking hours. Other breathing disturbance such a shallow breathing or short period of stopping breathing (apnea) can occur during sleep. Irritability and crying. Children with Rett syndrome may become increasingly agitated and irritable a they get older. Periods of cry or screaming may begin suddenly, for no apparent reason, and last for hours. Some child may experience fear and anxiety. Other unusual behaviors. These may include, for example, sudden, odd facial expression and long bout of laughter, hand licking, and grasping of hair or clothing. Intellectual disabilities.

Multiple seizure type may occur and are associated with change on an electroencephalogram (EEG). Sideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Scoliosis is common with Rett syndrome. It typically begin between 8 and 11 year of age and progress with age. Surgery may be required if the curvature is severe. Irregular heartbeat. This is a life-threatening problem for many child and adult with Rett syndrome and can result in sudden death. Sleep disturbances. Problems with sleep pattern can include irregular sleep times, falling asleep during the day and being awake at night, or waking in the night with cry or screaming. Other symptoms. A variety of other symptom can occur, such a a decreased response to pain; small hand and foot that are usually cold; problem with chewing and swallowing; problem with bowel function; and teeth grinding. Stages of Rett syndrome Rett syndrome is commonly divided into four stages: Stage 1: Early onset. Signs and symptom are subtle and easily overlooked during the first stage, which start between 6 and 18 month of age. Stage 1 can last for a few month or a year. Babies in this stage may show le eye contact and start to lose interest in toys. They may also have delay in sitting or crawling. Stage 2: Rapid deterioration. Starting between 1 and 4 year of age, child lose the ability to perform skill they previously had. This loss can be rapid or more gradual, occurring over week or months. Symptoms of Rett syndrome occur, such a slowed head growth, abnormal hand movements, hyperventilating, screaming or cry for no apparent reason, problem with movement and coordination, and a loss of social interaction and communication. Stage 3: Plateau. The third stage usually begin between the age of 2 and 10 years, and it can last for many years. Although problem with movement continue, behavior may slightly improve, with le cry and irritability, and there may be some improvement in hand use and communication. Seizures may begin in this stage and generally don't occur before the age of 2. Stage 4: Late motor deterioration. This stage usually begin after the age of 10 and can last for year or decades. It's marked by reduced mobility, muscle weakness, joint contracture and scoliosis. Understanding, communication and hand skill generally remain stable or improve slightly, and seizure may occur le often.",855,Rett Syndrome

Blood-clotting factor are substance in your blood that help stop bleeding. These abnormality can lead to small blood clot forming more often than they normally would. In addition, people with calciphylaxis have an imbalance in the metabolism of calcium.

"Children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) may have many speech symptom or characteristic that vary depending on their age and the severity of their speech problems. CAS can be associated with: CAS Delayed onset of first word A limited number of spoken word The ability to form only a few consonant or vowel sound These symptom are usually noticed between age 18 month and 2 years, and may indicate suspected CAS. CAS As child produce more speech, usually between age 2 and 4, characteristic that likely indicate CAS include: CAS Vowel and consonant distortion Separation of syllable in or between word Voicing errors, such a ""pie"" sounding like ""bye"" Many child with CAS have difficulty getting their jaws, lip and tongue to the correct position to make a sound, and they may have difficulty moving smoothly to the next sound. CAS Many child with CAS also have language problems, such a reduced vocabulary or difficulty with word order. CAS Some symptom may be unique to child with CAS and can be helpful to diagnose the problem. However, some symptom of CAS are also symptom of other type of speech or language disorders. It's difficult to diagnose CAS if a child ha only symptom that are found both in CAS and in other type of speech or language disorders. CAS CAS CAS CAS Some characteristics, sometimes called markers, help distinguish CAS from other type of speech disorders. Those particularly associated with CAS include: CAS CAS Difficulty moving smoothly from one sound, syllable or word to another Groping movement with the jaw, lip or tongue to make the correct movement for speech sound Vowel distortions, such a attempting to use the correct vowel, but saying it incorrectly Using the wrong stress in a word, such a pronouncing ""banana"" a ""BUH-nan-uh"" instead of ""buh-NAN-uh"" Using equal emphasis on all syllables, such a saying ""BUH-NAN-UH"" Separation of syllables, such a putting a pause or gap between syllable Inconsistency, such a making different error when trying to say the same word a second time Difficulty imitating simple word Inconsistent voicing errors, such a saying ""down"" instead of ""town"" Other characteristic are seen in most child with speech or language problem and aren't helpful in distinguishing CAS. Characteristics seen both in child with CAS and in child with other type of speech or language disorder include: CAS CAS Babbling le or making fewer vocal sound than is typical between the age of 7 to 12 month old Speaking first word late (after age 12 to 18 month old) Using a limited number of consonant and vowel Frequently leaving out (omitting) sound Using speech that is difficult to understand speech Other speech disorder sometimes confused with CAS Some speech sound disorder often get confused with CAS because some of the characteristic may overlap. These speech sound disorder include articulation disorders, phonological disorder and dysarthria. CAS A child who ha trouble learning how to make specific sounds, but doesn't have trouble planning or coordinating the movement to speak, may have an articulation or phonological disorder. Articulation and phonological disorder are more common than CAS. CAS Articulation or phonological speech error may include: Substituting sounds, such a saying ""fum"" instead of ""thumb,"" ""wabbit"" instead of ""rabbit"" or ""tup"" instead of ""cup"" Leaving out (omitting) final consonants, such a saying ""duh"" instead of ""duck"" or ""uh"" instead of ""up"" Stopping the airstream, such a saying ""tun"" instead of ""sun"" or ""doo"" instead of ""zoo"" Simplifying sound combinations, such a saying ""ting"" instead of ""string"" or ""fog"" instead of ""frog"" Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that is due to weakness, spasticity or inability to control the speech muscles. Making speech sound is difficult because the speech muscle can't move a far, a quickly or a strongly a normal. People with dysarthria may also have a hoarse, soft or even strained voice, or slurred or slow speech. Dysarthria is often easier to identify than CAS. However, when dysarthria is caused by damage to certain area of the brain that affect coordination, it can be difficult to determine the difference between CAS and dysarthria.",197,Childhood Apraxia Of Speech

"Schizophrenia involves a range of problem with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptom may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucination or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling. In most people with schizophrenia, symptom generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it start before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in child younger than age 13 is extremely rare. Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with period of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptom may always be present. Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases. Early sign and symptom Schizophrenia sign and symptom in child and teenager are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize in this age group. Early sign and symptom may include problem with thinking, behavior and emotions. Thinking: Problems with thinking and reasoning Bizarre idea or speech Confusing dream or television for reality Behavior: Withdrawal from friend and family Trouble sleeping Lack of motivation — for example, showing up a a drop in performance at school Not meeting daily expectations, such a bathing or dressing Bizarre behavior Violent or aggressive behavior or agitation Recreational drug or nicotine use Emotions: Irritability or depressed mood Lack of emotion, or emotion inappropriate for the situation Strange anxiety and fear Excessive suspicion of others Later sign and symptom As child with schizophrenia age, more typical sign and symptom of the disorder begin to appear. Signs and symptom may include: Delusions. These are false belief that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; that certain gesture or comment are directed at you; that you have exceptional ability or fame; that another person is in love with you; or that a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing thing that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, hallucination have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voice is the most common hallucination. Disorganized thinking. Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answer to question may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless word that can't be understood, sometimes known a word salad. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior is not focused on a goal, which make it hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion — doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions, speaks in a monotone, or doesn't add hand or head movement that normally occur when speaking. Also, the person may avoid people and activity or lack the ability to experience pleasure. Compared with schizophrenia symptom in adults, child and teen may be: Less likely to have delusion More likely to have visual hallucination Symptoms may be difficult to interpret When childhood schizophrenia begin early in life, symptom may build up gradually. Early sign and symptom may be so vague that you can't recognize what's wrong. Some early sign can be mistaken for typical development during early teen years, or they could be symptom of other mental or physical conditions. As time go on, sign may become more severe and more noticeable. Eventually, your child may develop the symptom of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusion and difficulty organizing thoughts. As thought become more disorganized, there's often a ""break from reality"" (psychosis) frequently requiring hospitalization and treatment with medication.",200,Childhood Schizophrenia

"Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, a well a vision. Skin The easiest form of albinism to see result in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with sibling or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same a that of parent or sibling without albinism. With exposure to the sun, some people may develop: Freckles. Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink. Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigo (len-TIJ-ih-neez). Sunburn and no ability to tan. For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight change in color. Hair Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with mineral in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age. Eye color Eyelashes and eyebrow are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age. With albinism, the colored part of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the iris and make the eye extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eye may appear red in some lighting. Vision Vision problem are a key feature of all type of albinism. Eye problem may include: Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eye that can't be controlled, called nystagmus. An uncommon head position or head posture, such a tilting the head to try to reduce eye movement and see better. Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus. Problems seeing near object or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness. Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia. A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which cause blurred vision. Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference result in reduced vision. Nerve signal from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathway in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve. Poor depth perception, which mean not being able to see thing in three dimension and judge how far away an object is. Legal blindness — vision le than 20/200 — or complete blindness.",29,Albinism

"Signs and symptom of Prader-Willi syndrome can vary among individuals. Symptoms may slowly change over time from childhood to adulthood. Infants Signs and symptom that may be present from birth include: Poor muscle tone. A primary sign during infancy is poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Babies may rest with their elbow and knee loosely extended instead of fixed, and they may feel floppy or like rag doll when they're held. Distinct facial features. Children may be born with almond-shaped eyes, a narrowing of the head at the temples, a turned-down mouth and a thin upper lip. Poor sucking reflex. Infants may have a poor sucking reflex due to decreased muscle tone. Poor sucking make feeding difficult and can result in failure to thrive. Generally poor responsiveness. A baby may seem unusually tired, respond poorly to stimulation, have a hard time waking up or have a weak cry. Underdeveloped genitals. Males may have a small penis and scrotum. The testicle may be small or not descended from the abdomen into the scrotum (cryptorchidism). In females, the clitoris and labium may be small. Early childhood to adulthood Other feature of Prader-Willi syndrome appear during early childhood and remain throughout life, requiring careful management. These feature may include: Food craving and weight gain. A classic sign of Prader-Willi syndrome is a constant craving for food, resulting in rapid weight gain, starting around age 2 years. Constant hunger lead to eating often and consuming large portions. Unusual food-seeking behaviors, such a hoarding food, or eating frozen food or even garbage, may develop. Underdeveloped sex organs. A condition called hypogonadism occurs when sex organ (testes in men and ovary in women) produce little or no sex hormones. This result in underdeveloped sex organs, incomplete or delayed puberty, and in nearly all cases, infertility. Without treatment, woman may not start menstruating until their 30 or may never menstruate, and men may not have much facial hair and their voice may never fully deepen. Poor growth and physical development. Underproduction of growth hormone can result in short adult height, low muscle mass and high body fat. Other endocrine problem may include underproduction of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or central adrenal insufficiency, which prevents the body from responding appropriately during stress or infections. Cognitive impairment. Mild to moderate intellectual disability, such a issue with thinking, reasoning and problem-solving, is a common feature of the disorder. Even those without significant intellectual disability have some learning disabilities. Delayed motor development. Toddlers with Prader-Willi syndrome often reach milestone in physical movement — for example, sitting up or walking — later than other child do. Speech problems. Speech is often delayed. Poor articulation of word may be an ongoing problem into adulthood. Behavioral problems. Children and adult may at time be stubborn, angry, controlling or manipulative. They may throw temper tantrums, especially when denied food, and may not tolerate change in routine. They may also develop obsessive-compulsive or repetitive behaviors, or both. Other mental health disorders, such a anxiety and skin picking, may develop. Sleep disorders. Children and adult with Prader-Willi syndrome may have sleep disorders, including disruption of the normal sleep cycle and a condition in which breathing pause during sleep (sleep apnea). These disorder can result in excessive daytime sleepiness and worsen behavior problems. Other sign and symptoms. These may include small hand and feet, curvature of the spine (scoliosis), hip problems, reduced saliva flow, nearsightedness and other vision problems, problem regulating body temperature, a high pain tolerance, or a lack of pigment (hypopigmentation) causing hair, eye and skin to be pale.",790,Prader Willi Syndrome

But when a cell's DNA is damaged and becomes cancerous, cell continue to divide — even when new cell aren't needed. As these cell accumulate, they form a tumor. With time, the cancer cell can grow to invade and destroy normal tissue nearby. And cancerous cell can spread (metastasize) to other part of the body. Risk factor Factors that may increase the risk of small bowel cancer include: Gene mutation passed through families. Some gene mutation that are inherited from your parent can increase your risk of small bowel cancer and other cancers. Examples include Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Other bowel diseases. Other disease and condition that affect the intestine may increase the risk of small bowel cancer, including Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. Weakened immune system. If your body's germ-fighting immune system is weakened, you may have an increased risk of small bowel cancer. Examples include people with HIV infection and those who take anti-rejection medicine after an organ transplant. Complications Small bowel cancer can cause complications, including: An increased risk of other cancers. People who have small bowel cancer run a higher risk of having other type of cancers, including those that affect the colon, rectum, ovary and the lining of the uterus (endometrium). Cancer that spread to other part of the body. Advanced small bowel cancer can spread (metastasize) to other part of the body, most often the liver. Prevention It's not clear what may help to reduce the risk of small bowel cancer, since it's very uncommon. If you're interested in reducing your risk of cancer in general, it may help to: Eat a variety of fruits, vegetable and whole grains. Fruits, vegetable and whole grain contain vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants, which may help reduce your risk of cancer and other diseases. Choose a variety of fruit and vegetable so that you get an array of vitamin and nutrients. Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day for woman of all age and men older than age 65, and up to two drink a day for men age 65 and younger. Stop smoking. Talk to your doctor about way to quit that may work for you. Exercise most day of the week. Try to get at least 30 minute of exercise on most days. If you've been inactive, start slowly and build up gradually to 30 minutes. Also, talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. Maintain a healthy weight. If you are at a healthy weight, work to maintain your weight by combining a healthy diet with daily exercise. If you need to lose weight, ask your doctor about healthy way to achieve your goal. Aim to lose weight slowly by increasing the amount of exercise you get and reducing the number of calorie you eat.

"Snoring is often associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Not all snorer have OSA, but if snoring is accompanied by any of the following symptoms, it may be an indication to see a doctor for further evaluation for OSA: Witnessed breathing pause during sleep Excessive daytime sleepiness Difficulty concentrating Morning headache Sore throat upon awakening Restless sleep Gasping or choking at night High blood pressure Chest pain at night Your snoring is so loud it's disrupting your partner's sleep In children, poor attention span, behavioral issue or poor performance in school OSA often is characterized by loud snoring followed by period of silence when breathing stop or nearly stops.

"The two main feature of amnesia are: Trouble learning new information. Trouble remembering past event and previously familiar information. Most people with amnesia have problem with short-term memory, so they can't retain new information. Recent memory are most likely to be lost. More-remote or deeply ingrained memory may be spared. For example, people may recall experience from childhood or know the name of past presidents. But they may not be able to name the current president, know the month or remember what they ate for breakfast. Isolated memory loss doesn't affect a person's intelligence, general knowledge, awareness or attention span. It also doesn't affect judgment, personality or identity. People with amnesia usually can understand written and spoken word and can learn skill such a bike riding or piano playing. They may understand they have a memory disorder. Amnesia isn't the same a dementia. Dementia often includes memory loss but also involves other problem with thinking that lead to a decline in daily functioning. These problem include having trouble with language, judgment and visual-spatial skills. Memory loss also is a common symptom of mild cognitive impairment. This disorder involves memory and other cognitive problem that aren't a severe a those experienced in dementia. Additional symptom Depending on the cause of the amnesia, other symptom may include: False memory that are either completely invented or are real memory misplaced in time.

The disease can be present with the appearance of a single chancre (shown here on a penis) or many. Syphilis develops in stages, and symptom vary with each stage. But the stage may overlap, and symptom don't always occur in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis without noticing any symptom for years. Primary syphilis The first sign of syphilis is a small sore, called a chancre (SHANG-kur). The sore appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. While most people infected with syphilis develop only one chancre, some people develop several of them. The chancre usually develops about three week after exposure. Many people who have syphilis don't notice the chancre because it's usually painless, and it may be hidden within the vagina or rectum. The chancre will heal on it own within three to six weeks. Secondary syphilis Within a few week of the original chancre healing, you may experience a rash that begin on your trunk but eventually cover your entire body — even the palm of your hand and the sol of your feet. This rash is usually not itchy and may be accompanied by wartlike sore in your mouth or genital area. Some people also experience hair loss, muscle aches, a fever, a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. These sign and symptom may disappear within a few week or repeatedly come and go for a long a a year. Latent syphilis If you aren't treated for syphilis, the disease move from the secondary stage to the hidden (latent) stage, when you have no symptoms. The latent stage can last for years. Signs and symptom may never return, or the disease may progress to the third (tertiary) stage. Tertiary syphilis About 15% to 30% of people infected with syphilis who don't get treatment will develop complication known a tertiary syphilis. In the late stage, the disease may damage the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bone and joints. These problem may occur many year after the original, untreated infection. Neurosyphilis At any stage, syphilis can spread and, among other damage, cause damage to the brain and nervous system and the eye. Congenital syphilis Babies born to woman who have syphilis can become infected through the placenta or during birth. Most newborn with congenital syphilis have no symptoms, although some experience a rash on the palm of their hand and the sol of their feet. Later sign and symptom may include deafness, teeth deformity and saddle nose — where the bridge of the nose collapses.

"The most common symptom associated with the yip is an involuntary muscle jerk, although some people experience tremors, twitches, spasm or freezing. Causes In some people, the yip are a type of focal dystonia, a condition that cause involuntary muscle contraction during a specific task. It's most likely related to overuse of a certain set of muscles, similar to writer's cramp. Anxiety worsens the effect. Some athlete become so anxious and self-focused — overthinking to the point of distraction — that their ability to execute a skill, such a putting, is impaired.

"Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizure can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure sign and symptom may include: Temporary confusion A staring spell Stiff muscle Uncontrollable jerking movement of the arm and leg Loss of consciousness or awareness Psychological symptom such a fear, anxiety or deja vu Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptom will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizure a either focal or generalized, based on how and where the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizure When seizure appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizure fall into two categories: Focal seizure without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizure don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotion or change the way thing look, smell, feel, taste or sound. Some people experience deja vu. This type of seizure may also result in involuntary jerking of one body part, such a an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptom such a tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizure with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizure involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. This type of seizure may seem like being in a dream. During a focal seizure with impaired awareness, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such a hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizure may be confused with other neurological disorders, such a migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizure Seizures that appear to involve all area of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six type of generalized seizure exist. Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known a petit mal seizures, typically occur in children. They're characterized by staring into space with or without subtle body movement such a eye blinking or lip smacking and only last between 5-10 seconds. These seizure may occur in clusters, happening a often a 100 time per day, and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizure cause stiff muscle and may affect consciousness. These seizure usually affect muscle in your back, arm and leg and may cause you to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known a drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control. Since this most often affect the legs, it often cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizure are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizure usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizure usually appear a sudden brief jerk or twitch and usually affect the upper body, arm and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known a grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness and body stiffening, twitching and shaking. They sometimes cause loss of bladder control or biting your tongue.",350,Epilepsy

"Signs and symptom — other than short stature — vary considerably across the spectrum of disorders. Disproportionate dwarfism Most people with dwarfism have disorder that cause disproportionately short stature. Usually, this mean that a person ha an average-size trunk and very short limbs, but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened (but disproportionately large) limbs. In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body. Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities. Rare exception are usually the result of a secondary factor, such a excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus). The most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia, which cause disproportionately short stature. This disorder usually result in the following: An average-size trunk Short arm and legs, with particularly short upper arm and upper leg Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring finger Limited mobility at the elbow A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose Progressive development of bowed leg Progressive development of swayed lower back An adult height around 4 foot (122 cm) Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include: A very short trunk A short neck Shortened arm and leg Average-size hand and foot Broad, rounded chest Slightly flattened cheekbone Opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) Hip deformity that result in thighbone turning inward A foot that's twisted or out of shape Instability of the neck bone Progressive hunching curvature of the upper spine Progressive development of swayed lower back Vision and hearing problem Arthritis and problem with joint movement Adult height ranging from 3 foot (91 cm) to just over 4 foot (122 cm) Proportionate dwarfism Proportionate dwarfism result from medical condition present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head, trunk and limb are all small, but they're proportionate to each other. Because these disorder affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems. Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone, which is essential for normal childhood growth. Signs include: Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth chart Growth rate slower than expected for age Delayed or no sexual development during the teen year",319,Dwarfism

"The average time from infection to appearance of sign and symptom (incubation period) is 10 days. The incubation period can range from 3 to 21 days. The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus. Signs and symptom begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks. They usually start at the jaw and progress downward on the body. Signs and symptom of generalized tetanus include: Painful muscle spasm and stiff, immovable muscle (muscle rigidity) in your jaw Tension of muscle around your lips, sometimes producing a persistent grin Painful spasm and rigidity in your neck muscle Difficulty swallowing Rigid abdominal muscle Progression of tetanus result in repeated painful, seizure-like spasm that last for several minute (generalized spasms). Usually, the neck and back arch, the leg become rigid, the arm are drawn up to the body, and the fist are clenched. Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties. These severe spasm may be triggered by minor event that stimulate the sens — a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light. As the disease progresses, other sign and symptom may include: High blood pressure Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Fever Extreme sweating Localized tetanus This uncommon form of tetanus result in muscle spasm near the site of a wound. While it's usually a le severe form of disease, it can progress to generalized tetanus. Cephalic tetanus This rare form of tetanus result from a head wound. It result in weakened muscle in the face and spasm of the jaw muscles. It also can progress to generalized tetanus.",977,Tetanus

Other eating disorder include rumination disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Anorexia nervosa Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa — often simply called anorexia — is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted perception of weight or shape. People with anorexia use extreme effort to control their weight and shape, which often significantly interferes with their health and life activities. When you have anorexia, you excessively limit calorie or use other method to lose weight, such a excessive exercise, using laxative or diet aids, or vomiting after eating. Efforts to reduce your weight, even when underweight, can cause severe health problems, sometimes to the point of deadly self-starvation. Bulimia nervosa Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa — commonly called bulimia — is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. When you have bulimia, you have episode of bingeing and purging that involve feeling a lack of control over your eating. Many people with bulimia also restrict their eating during the day, which often lead to more binge eating and purging. During these episodes, you typically eat a large amount of food in a short time, and then try to rid yourself of the extra calorie in an unhealthy way. Because of guilt, shame and an intense fear of weight gain from overeating, you may force vomiting or you may exercise too much or use other methods, such a laxatives, to get rid of the calories. If you have bulimia, you're probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape, and may judge yourself severely and harshly for your self-perceived flaws. You may be at a normal weight or even a bit overweight. Binge-eating disorder When you have binge-eating disorder, you regularly eat too much food (binge) and feel a lack of control over your eating. You may eat quickly or eat more food than intended, even when you're not hungry, and you may continue eating even long after you're uncomfortably full. After a binge, you may feel guilty, disgusted or ashamed by your behavior and the amount of food eaten. But you don't try to compensate for this behavior with excessive exercise or purging, a someone with bulimia or anorexia might. Embarrassment can lead to eating alone to hide your bingeing. A new round of bingeing usually occurs at least once a week. You may be normal weight, overweight or obese. Rumination disorder Rumination disorder is repeatedly and persistently regurgitating food after eating, but it's not due to a medical condition or another eating disorder such a anorexia, bulimia or binge-eating disorder. Food is brought back up into the mouth without nausea or gagging, and regurgitation may not be intentional. Sometimes regurgitated food is rechewed and reswallowed or spit out. The disorder may result in malnutrition if the food is spit out or if the person eats significantly le to prevent the behavior. The occurrence of rumination disorder may be more common in infancy or in people who have an intellectual disability. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder This disorder is characterized by failing to meet your minimum daily nutrition requirement because you don't have an interest in eating; you avoid food with certain sensory characteristics, such a color, texture, smell or taste; or you're concerned about the consequence of eating, such a fear of choking. Food is not avoided because of fear of gaining weight. The disorder can result in significant weight loss or failure to gain weight in childhood, a well a nutritional deficiency that can cause health problems.",327,Eating Disorders

This depends on the number of larva eaten in the infected meat. Possibly no sign or symptom Mild case of trichinosis — those with only a small number of parasite in your body — may cause no sign or symptoms. Symptoms can develop with moderate or heavy infestation ⸺ a large number of parasite in your body. These symptom sometimes get worse a the roundworm (trichinella) larva travel through your body. Initial sign and symptom You swallow roundworm (trichinella) larva in tiny sack (cysts) containing the parasite. Your digestive juice dissolve the cysts, releasing the larva into your body. The larva then enter the wall of your small intestine, where they grow into adult worm and mate. Digestive symptom can begin 1 to 2 day after infection. At this stage, you may experience: Diarrhea Stomach (abdominal) pain Severe tiredness and weakness (fatigue) Nausea and vomiting Later sign and symptom About a week after infection, the adult female worm produce larvae. The larva go through the wall of your intestine and enter your bloodstream, They travel around the body and bury themselves in muscle tissue. Here, each larva coil up and form a cyst around itself. The larva can live for month to year inside the muscle tissue. Symptoms caused by muscle tissue invasion usually start 2 to 8 week after infection and include: High fever and chill Muscle pain and tenderness Aching joint Swelling of the eyelid or face Weakness Headache Sensitivity to light Pink eye (conjunctivitis) Itchy, irritated skin With a large number of parasites, muscle pain and weakness can be severe. This can limit moving, breathing and speaking. Symptoms last for several months. But symptom generally lessen when the larva form cysts. Even after the infection is gone, fatigue, mild pain, weakness and diarrhea may last for month or years.",1010,Trichinosis

"Priapism symptom vary depending on the type of priapism. The two main type of priapism are ischemic priapism and nonischemic priapism. Ischemic priapism Ischemic priapism, also called low-flow priapism, is the result of blood not being able to leave the penis. Blood is trapped in the penis because it cannot flow out of the vein of the penis or there is a problem with the contraction of smooth muscle within the erectile tissue of the penis. Ischemic priapism is the more common type of priapism and requires immediate medical care to prevent complication caused by not getting enough oxygen to the penile tissue. Signs and symptom include: Erection lasting more than four hour or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation Rigid penile shaft, but the tip of penis (glans) is soft Progressively worsening penile pain Stuttering priapism — also called recurrent or intermittent priapism — is a form of ischemic priapism. An uncommon condition, stuttering priapism describes repetitive episode of prolonged erection and often includes episode of ischemic priapism. It occurs more often in male who have an inherited disorder characterized by abnormally shaped red blood cell (sickle cell disease). Sickle cell can block the blood vessel in the penis. In some cases, the condition start off with unwanted and painful erection of short duration and might progress over time to more-frequent and more-prolonged erections. Stuttering priapism may begin in childhood. Nonischemic priapism Nonischemic priapism, also known a high-flow priapism, occurs when blood flow through the artery of the penis isn't working properly. However, the penile tissue continue to receive some blood flow and oxygen. Nonischemic priapism often occurs due to trauma. Signs and symptom include: Erection lasting more than four hour or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation Erect but not fully rigid penile shaft Usually not painful",804,Priapism

"Primary progressive aphasia symptom vary, depending on which portion of the brain's language area are involved. The condition ha three types, which cause different symptoms. Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia Signs and symptom include: Difficulty comprehending spoken or written language, particularly single word Trouble comprehending word meaning Struggling to name object Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia Signs and symptom include: Difficulty retrieving word and word substitution Frequently pausing in speech while searching for word Difficulty repeating phrase or sentence Nonfluent-agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia Signs and symptom include: Poor grammar in written and spoken form Trouble understanding complex sentence Using grammar incorrectly May be accompanied by speaking problem such a error in speech sound (known a apraxia of speech) Causes Primary progressive aphasia is caused by a shrinking (atrophy) of certain section (lobes) of the brain responsible for speech and language. In this case, the frontal, temporal or parietal lobes, primarily on the left side of the brain, are affected. Atrophy is associated with the presence of abnormal proteins, and brain activity or function in affected area might be reduced. Risk factor Risk factor for primary progressive aphasia include: Learning disabilities. If you had a childhood learning disability, particularly developmental dyslexia, you might be at somewhat higher risk of primary progressive aphasia. Certain gene mutations. Rare gene mutation have been linked to the disorder. If other member of your family have had primary progressive aphasia, you might be more likely to develop it. Complications People with primary progressive aphasia eventually lose the ability to speak and write, and to understand written and spoken language. Some people develop substantial difficulty forming sound to speak (a problem called apraxia of speech), even when their ability to write and comprehend are not significantly impaired. As the disease progresses, other mental skills, such a memory, can become impaired. Some people develop other neurological symptom such a problem with movement. With these complications, the affected person eventually will need help with day-to-day care. People with primary progressive aphasia can also develop depression or behavioral or social problem a the disease progresses. Other problem might include blunted emotion such a unconcern, poor judgment or inappropriate social behavior.

Causes There are no known cause for a sacral dimple. It is a congenital condition, meaning it's present at birth. Complications Rarely, sacral dimple are associated with a serious underlying abnormality of the spine or spinal cord. Examples include: Spina bifida. A very mild form of this condition, called spina bifida occulta, occurs when the spine doesn't close properly around the spinal cord, but the cord remains within the spinal canal. In most cases, spina bifida occulta cause no symptom and doesn't need treatment. Tethered cord syndrome. The spinal cord normally hang freely within the spinal canal. Tethered cord syndrome is a disorder that occurs when tissue attached to the spinal cord limit it movements.

This melanoma show color variation and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs. Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in area that have had exposure to the sun, such a your back, legs, arm and face. Melanomas can also occur in area that don't receive much sun exposure, such a the sol of your feet, palm of your hand and fingernail beds. These hidden melanoma are more common in people with darker skin. The first melanoma sign and symptom often are: A change in an existing mole The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin Melanoma doesn't always begin a a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal mole Normal mole are generally a uniform color — such a tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most mole begin appearing in childhood and new mole may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual mole that may indicate melanoma To help you identify characteristic of unusual mole that may indicate melanoma or other skin cancers, think of the letter ABCDE: A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for mole with irregular shapes, such a two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for mole with irregular, notched or scalloped border — characteristic of melanomas. C is for change in color. Look for growth that have many color or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). E is for evolving. Look for change over time, such a a mole that grows in size or that change color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new sign and symptoms, such a new itchiness or bleeding. Cancerous (malignant) mole vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the change listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanoma Melanomas can also develop in area of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such a the space between your toe and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to a hidden melanoma because they occur in place most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanoma include: Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palm of the hand or the sol of the feet. It's more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that line the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanoma are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea — the layer beneath the white of the eye (sclera).

During prenatal visits, your health care provider might measure your fundal height — the distance from the top of your uterus to your pubic bone. A larger than expected fundal height could be a sign of fetal macrosomia. Excessive amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios). Having too much amniotic fluid — the fluid that surround and protects a baby during pregnancy — might be a sign that your baby is larger than average. The amount of amniotic fluid reflects your baby's urine output, and a larger baby produce more urine. Some condition that cause a baby to be larger might also increase his or her urine output.",375,Fetal Macrosomia

When wart do appear, they vary in appearance depending on which kind of HPV is involved: HPV HPV Genital warts. These appear a flat lesions, small cauliflower-like bump or tiny stemlike protrusions. In women, genital wart appear mostly on the vulva but can also occur near the anus, on the cervix or in the vagina. In men, genital wart appear on the penis and scrotum or around the anus. Genital wart rarely cause discomfort or pain, though they may itch or feel tender. Common warts. Common wart appear a rough, raised bump and usually occur on the hand and fingers. In most cases, common wart are simply unsightly, but they can also be painful or susceptible to injury or bleeding. Plantar warts. Plantar wart are hard, grainy growth that usually appear on the heel or ball of your feet. These wart might cause discomfort. Flat warts. Flat wart are flat-topped, slightly raised lesions. They can appear anywhere, but child usually get them on the face and men tend to get them in the beard area. Women tend to get them on the legs. Cervical cancer Nearly all cervical cancer are caused by HPV infections, but cervical cancer may take 20 year or longer to develop after an HPV infection. The HPV infection and early cervical cancer typically don't cause noticeable symptoms. Getting vaccinated against HPV infection is your best protection from cervical cancer. HPV HPV HPV HPV Because early cervical cancer doesn't cause symptoms, it's vital that woman have regular screening test to detect any precancerous change in the cervix that might lead to cancer. Current guideline recommend that woman age 21 to 29 have a Pap test every three years. Women age 30 to 65 are advised to continue having a Pap test every three years, or every five year if they also get the HPV DNA test at the same time. Women over 65 can stop testing if they've had three normal Pap test in a row, or two HPV DNA and Pap test with no abnormal results.",489,Hpv Infection

"The most common sign of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart rate greater than 100 beat a minute. Episodes of a fast heart rate (tachycardia) can begin suddenly and may last a few second or several hours. Episodes can occur during exercise or while at rest. Other sign and symptom of WPW syndrome are related to the fast heart rate and underlying heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia). The most common arrhythmia seen with WPW syndrome is supraventricular tachycardia. Supraventricular tachycardia cause episode of a fast, pounding heartbeat that begin and end abruptly. Some people with WPW syndrome also have a fast and chaotic heart rhythm problem called atrial fibrillation.

"Signs and symptom of acoustic neuroma are often easy to miss and may take many year to develop. They usually happen because of the tumor's effect on the hearing and balance nerves. Pressure from the tumor on nearby nerve controlling facial muscle and sensation (facial and trigeminal nerves), nearby blood vessels, or brain structure may also cause problems. As the tumor grows, it may cause more noticeable or severe sign and symptoms. Common sign and symptom of acoustic neuroma include: Hearing loss, usually gradually worsening over month to year — although in rare case sudden — and occurring on only one side or more severe on one side Ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear Unsteadiness or loss of balance Dizziness (vertigo) Facial numbness and weakness or loss of muscle movement In rare cases, an acoustic neuroma may grow large enough to compress the brainstem and become life-threatening. When to see your doctor See your doctor if you notice hearing loss in one ear, ringing in your ear or trouble with your balance. Early diagnosis of an acoustic neuroma may help keep the tumor from growing large enough to cause serious consequences, such a total hearing loss.",8,Acoustic Neuroma

"Signs and symptom of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease may include: Weakness in your legs, ankle and foot Loss of muscle bulk in your leg and foot High foot arch Curled toe (hammertoes) Decreased ability to run Difficulty lifting your foot at the ankle (footdrop) Awkward or higher than normal step (gait) Frequent tripping or falling Decreased sensation or a loss of feeling in your leg and foot As Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease progresses, symptom may spread from the foot and leg to the hand and arms. The severity of symptom can vary greatly from person to person, even among family members. Causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is an inherited, genetic condition. It occurs when there are mutation in the gene that affect the nerve in your feet, legs, hand and arms. Sometimes, these mutation damage the nerves. Other mutation damage the protective coating that surround the nerve (myelin sheath). Both cause weaker message to travel between your limb and brain. Risk factor Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is hereditary, so you're at higher risk of developing the disorder if anyone in your immediate family ha the disease. Other cause of neuropathies, such a diabetes, may cause symptom similar to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. These other condition can also cause the symptom of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease to become worse. Medications such a the chemotherapy drug vincristine (Marqibo), paclitaxel (Abraxane) and others can make symptom worse. Be sure to let your doctor know about all of the medication you're taking. Complications Complications of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease vary in severity from person to person. Foot abnormality and difficulty walking are usually the most serious problems. Muscles may get weaker, and you may injure area of the body that experience decreased sensation. Sometimes the muscle in your foot may not receive your brain's signal to contract, so you're more likely to trip and fall. And your brain may not receive pain message from your feet, so if you've rubbed a blister on your toe, for example, it may get infected without your realizing it. You may also experience difficulty breathing, swallowing or speaking if the muscle that control these function are affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

"Most septal displacement result in no symptoms, and you may not even know you have a deviated septum. Some septal deformities, however, may cause the following sign and symptoms: Obstruction of one or both nostrils. This blockage can make it difficult to breathe through the nostril or nostrils. You may notice this more when you have a cold or allergy that can cause your nasal passage to swell and narrow. Nosebleeds. The surface of your nasal septum may become dry, increasing your risk of nosebleeds. Facial pain. There is some debate about the possible nasal cause of facial pain. A possible cause of one-sided facial pain could be a severe deviated septum in which surface within the nose touch and cause pressure. Noisy breathing during sleep. A deviated septum or swelling of the tissue in your nose can be one of the many reason for noisy breathing during sleep. Awareness of the nasal cycle. The nose alternate between being obstructed on one side and then change to being obstructed on the other. This is called the nasal cycle. Being aware of the nasal cycle isn't typical and can indicate nasal obstruction. Preference for sleeping on a particular side. Some people may prefer to sleep on a particular side to optimize breathing through the nose at night if one nasal passage is narrowed.",283,Deviated Septum

"There are many different type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the most common sign and symptom include: Overly flexible joints. Because the connective tissue that hold joint together is looser, your joint can move far past the normal range of motion. Joint pain and dislocation are common. Stretchy skin. Weakened connective tissue allows your skin to stretch much more than usual. You may be able to pull a pinch of skin up away from your flesh, but it will snap right back into place when you let go. Your skin might also feel exceptionally soft and velvety. Fragile skin. Damaged skin often doesn't heal well. For example, the stitch used to close a wound often will tear out and leave a gaping scar. These scar may look thin and crinkly. Symptom severity can vary from person to person and depends on the specific type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that you have. The most common type is called hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome often share distinctive facial feature of a thin nose, thin upper lip, small earlobe and prominent eyes. They also have thin, translucent skin that bruise very easily. In fair-skinned people, the underlying blood vessel are very visible through the skin. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can weaken your heart's largest artery (aorta), a well a the artery to other region of your body. A rupture of any of these larger blood vessel can be fatal. The vascular type can also weaken the wall of the uterus or large intestine — which also may rupture. Causes Different type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are associated with a variety of genetic causes, some of which are inherited and passed on from parent to child. If you have the most common form, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, there's a 50% chance that you'll pas on the gene to each of your children. Complications Complications depend on the type of sign and symptom you have. For example, overly flexible joint can result in joint dislocation and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal rupture of major blood vessels. Some organs, such a the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus. Prevention If you have a personal or family history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and you're thinking about starting a family, you may benefit from talking to a genetic counselor — a health care professional trained to ass the risk of inherited disorders. Genetic counseling can help you understand the inheritance pattern of the type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that affect you and the risk it pose for your children.

In infants, the rash is mainly found on the neck, shoulder and chest. It can also show up in the armpits, elbow crease and groin. Types of heat rash The type of heat rash are classified according to how deep the sweat is trapped in the skin. Signs and symptom for each type vary. The mildest form of heat rash is called miliaria crystallina. It occurs when the opening of the sweat duct on the surface of the skin (sweat pore) is blocked. This form is marked by tiny, clear, fluid-filled bump that break easily. A type that occurs deeper in the skin is called miliaria rubra. It is sometimes called prickly heat. Signs and symptom include small, inflamed blister-like bump and itching or prickling in the affected area. Occasionally, the inflamed bump of miliaria rubra fill with pus. This form is called miliaria pustulosa. A le common form of heat rash is called miliaria profunda. It affect the deepest layer of the skin (dermis).

In addition, certain substance accumulate in the brain. What cause these change is usually unknown. There are genetic mutation that have been linked to frontotemporal dementia. But more than half of the people who develop frontotemporal dementia have no family history of dementia. Recently, researcher have confirmed shared genetics and molecular pathway between frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). More research need to be done to understand the connection between these conditions, however. Risk factor Your risk of developing frontotemporal dementia is higher if you have a family history of dementia. There are no other known risk factors.

"Chest pain is the most common symptom of pericarditis. It usually feel sharp or stabbing. However, some people have dull, achy or pressure-like chest pain. Pericarditis pain usually occurs behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest. The pain may: Spread to the left shoulder and neck Get worse when coughing, lying down or taking a deep breath Get better when sitting up or leaning forward Other sign and symptom of pericarditis may include: Cough Fatigue or general feeling of weakness or being sick Leg swelling Low-grade fever Pounding or racing heartbeat (heart palpitations) Shortness of breath when lying down Swelling of the belly (abdomen) The specific symptom depend on the type of pericarditis. Pericarditis is grouped into different categories, according to the pattern of symptom and how long symptom last. Acute pericarditis begin suddenly but doesn't last longer than three weeks. Future episode can occur. It may be difficult to tell the difference between acute pericarditis and pain due to a heart attack. Recurrent pericarditis occurs about four to six week after an episode of acute pericarditis with no symptom in between. Incessant pericarditis last about four to six week but le than three months. The symptom are continuous. Chronic constrictive pericarditis usually develops slowly and last longer than three months.",738,Pericarditis

Symptoms can range from minor to severe, including: Fever Cough Tiredness Shortness of breath Headache Chills Night sweat Joint ache and muscle soreness Red, spotty rash, mainly on lower leg but sometimes on the chest, arm and back If you don't become ill or have symptom from valley fever, you may only find out you've been infected later. You may find out when you have a positive skin or blood test or when small area of residual infection in the lung (nodules) show up on a routine chest X-ray. The nodule typically don't cause problems, but they can look like cancer on X-rays. If you develop symptoms, especially severe ones, the course of the disease is highly variable. It can take month to fully recover. Fatigue and joint ache can last even longer. The disease's severity depends on several factors, including your overall health and the number of fungus spore you inhale. Chronic coccidioidomycosis If the initial coccidioidomycosis infection doesn't completely resolve, it may progress to a chronic form of pneumonia. This complication is most common in people with weakened immune systems. Signs and symptom include: Low-grade fever Weight loss Cough Chest pain Blood-tinged sputum (matter discharged during coughing) Nodules in the lung Disseminated coccidioidomycosis The most serious form of the disease, disseminated coccidioidomycosis, is uncommon. It occurs when the infection spread (disseminates) beyond the lung to other part of the body. Most often these part include the skin, bones, liver, brain, heart, and the membrane that protect the brain and spinal cord (meninges). Signs and symptom of disseminated disease depend on the body part affected and may include: Nodules, ulcer and skin lesion that are more serious than the rash that sometimes occurs with initial infection Painful lesion in the skull, spine or other bone Painful, swollen joints, especially in the knee or ankle Meningitis — an infection of the membrane and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord",1045,Valley Fever

"Signs and symptom of sarcoma include: A lump that can be felt through the skin that may or may not be painful Bone pain A broken bone that happens unexpectedly, such a with a minor injury or no injury at all Abdominal pain Weight loss Causes It's not clear what cause most sarcomas. In general, cancer form when change (mutations) happen in the DNA within cells. The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instruction telling the cell what function to perform, a well a how to grow and divide. Mutations might tell cell to grow and divide uncontrollably and to continue living when normal cell would die. If this happens, the accumulating abnormal cell can form a tumor. Cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other part of the body. Risk factor Factors that can increase the risk of sarcoma include: Inherited syndromes. Some syndrome that increase the risk of cancer can be passed from parent to children. Examples of syndrome that increase the risk of sarcoma include familial retinoblastoma and neurofibromatosis type 1. Radiation therapy for cancer. Radiation treatment for cancer increase the risk of developing a sarcoma later. Chronic swelling (lymphedema). Lymphedema is swelling caused by a backup of lymph fluid that occurs when the lymphatic system is blocked or damaged. It increase the risk of a type of sarcoma called angiosarcoma. Exposure to chemicals. Certain chemicals, such a some industrial chemical and herbicides, can increase the risk of sarcoma that affect the liver. Exposure to viruses. The virus called human herpesvirus 8 can increase the risk of a type of sarcoma called Kaposi's sarcoma in people with weakened immune systems.

The baby may vomit forcefully, ejecting breast milk or formula up to several foot away. This is known a projectile vomiting. Vomiting might be mild at first. But over time, it becomes more severe a the pylorus opening narrows. The vomit may sometimes contain blood. Persistent hunger. Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting. Stomach contractions. You may notice wavelike contraction that ripple across your baby's upper stomach area soon after feeding but before vomiting. These contraction are part of the digestive process known a peristalsis. The contraction are caused by stomach muscle trying to force food through the narrowed pylorus. Dehydration. Your baby might cry without tear or become lethargic. You might find yourself changing fewer wet diaper or diaper that aren't a wet a you expect. Changes in bowel movements.

"Bee sting can produce different reactions, ranging from temporary pain and discomfort to a severe allergic reaction. Having one type of reaction doesn't mean you'll always have the same reaction every time you're stung or that the next reaction will necessarily be more severe. Mild reaction Most of the time, bee sting symptom are minor and include: Instant, sharp burning pain at the sting site A red welt at the sting area Slight swelling around the sting area In most people, the swelling and pain go away within a few hours. Moderate reaction Some people who get stung by a bee or other insect have a bit stronger reaction, with sign and symptom such as: Extreme redness Swelling at the site of the sting that gradually enlarges over the next day or two Moderate reaction tend to resolve over five to 10 days. Having a moderate reaction doesn't mean you'll have a severe allergic reaction the next time you're stung. But some people develop similar moderate reaction each time they're stung. If this happens to you, talk to your doctor about treatment and prevention, especially if the reaction becomes more severe each time. Severe allergic reaction A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to bee sting is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. A small percentage of people who are stung by a bee or other insect quickly develop anaphylaxis. Signs and symptom of anaphylaxis include: Skin reactions, including hive and itching and flushed or pale skin Difficulty breathing Swelling of the throat and tongue A weak, rapid pulse Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Dizziness or fainting Loss of consciousness People who have a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting have a 25% to 65% chance of anaphylaxis the next time they're stung. Talk to your doctor or an allergy specialist about prevention measure such a immunotherapy (""allergy shots"") to avoid a similar reaction in case you get stung again. Multiple bee sting Generally, insect such a bee and wasp aren't aggressive and only sting in self-defense. In most cases, this result in one or perhaps a few stings. In some case a person will disrupt a hive or swarm of bee and get multiple stings. Some type of bee — such a Africanized honeybee — are more likely than are other bee to swarm, stinging in a group. If you get stung more than a dozen times, the accumulation of venom may induce a toxic reaction and make you feel quite sick.

Laughter often turn to tears. Your mood will appear normal between episodes, which can occur at any time. Crying appears to be a more common sign of PBA than laughing.

For example, you might laugh uncontrollably in response to a mildly amusing comment. Or you might laugh or cry in situation that others don't see a funny or sad. These emotional response typically represent a change from how you would have previously responded. Because pseudobulbar affect often involves crying, the condition is frequently mistaken for depression. However, PBA episode tend to be short in duration, while depression cause a persistent feeling of sadness.

"The primary feature of ADHD include inattention and hyperactive-impulsive behavior. ADHD symptom start before age 12, and in some children, they're noticeable a early a 3 year of age. ADHD symptom can be mild, moderate or severe, and they may continue into adulthood. ADHD ADHD ADHD ADHD occurs more often in male than in females, and behavior can be different in boy and girls. For example, boy may be more hyperactive and girl may tend to be quietly inattentive. ADHD There are three subtypes of ADHD: ADHD Predominantly inattentive. The majority of symptom fall under inattention. Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive. The majority of symptom are hyperactive and impulsive. Combined. This is a mix of inattentive symptom and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms. Inattention A child who show a pattern of inattention may often: Fail to pay close attention to detail or make careless mistake in schoolwork Have trouble staying focused in task or play Appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly Have difficulty following through on instruction and fail to finish schoolwork or chore Have trouble organizing task and activity Avoid or dislike task that require focused mental effort, such a homework Lose item needed for task or activities, for example, toys, school assignments, pencil Be easily distracted Forget to do some daily activities, such a forgetting to do chore Hyperactivity and impulsivity A child who show a pattern of hyperactive and impulsive symptom may often: Fidget with or tap his or her hand or feet, or squirm in the seat Have difficulty staying seated in the classroom or in other situation Be on the go, in constant motion Run around or climb in situation when it's not appropriate Have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly Talk too much Blurt out answers, interrupting the questioner Have difficulty waiting for his or her turn Interrupt or intrude on others' conversations, game or activity Typical developmental behavior vs. ADHD Most healthy child are inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive at one time or another. It's typical for preschooler to have short attention span and be unable to stick with one activity for long. Even in older child and teenagers, attention span often depends on the level of interest. The same is true of hyperactivity. Young child are naturally energetic — they often are still full of energy long after they've worn their parent out. In addition, some child just naturally have a higher activity level than others do. Children should never be classified a having ADHD just because they're different from their friend or siblings. ADHD Children who have problem in school but get along well at home or with friend are likely struggling with something other than ADHD. The same is true of child who are hyperactive or inattentive at home, but whose schoolwork and friendship remain unaffected.",19,Adhd

"People who have KTS may have the following features, which can range from mild to more extensive: KTS Port-wine stain. This pink to reddish-purple birthmark is caused by extra tiny blood vessel (capillaries) in the top layer of skin. The birthmark often cover part of one leg but can involve any portion of the skin. It may get darker or lighter with age. Vein malformations. These include swollen, twisted vein (varicose veins), usually on the surface of the legs. Deeper malformed vein in the arms, legs, abdomen and pelvis also can occur. There may be spongy tissue filled with small vein in or under the skin. Malformed vein may become more prominent with age. Overgrowth of bone and soft tissue. This begin in infancy and may be limited to one leg, but it can occur in an arm or, rarely, in the trunk or face. This overgrowth of bone and tissue creates a larger and longer extremity. Rarely, there may be fusion of finger or toe or extra finger or toes. Lymphatic system malformations. The lymphatic system — part of the immune system that protects against infection and disease and transport lymphatic fluid — can be malformed. Extra lymphatic vessel can be present that don't work properly and can lead to fluid leakage into the tissue and swelling. Other conditions. KTS can also include cataracts, glaucoma, hip dislocation at birth, purple-red skin coloring when cold and blood-clotting problems.",559,Klippel Trenaunay

"The sign and symptom of a brain tumor depend on the brain tumor's size and location. Symptoms also might depend on how fast the brain tumor is growing, which is also called the tumor grade. General sign and symptom caused by brain tumor may include: Headache or pressure in the head that is worse in the morning. Headaches that happen more often and seem more severe. Headaches that are sometimes described a tension headache or migraines. Nausea or vomiting. Eye problems, such a blurry vision, seeing double or losing sight on the side of your vision. Losing feeling or movement in an arm or a leg. Trouble with balance. Speech problems. Feeling very tired. Confusion in everyday matters. Memory problems. Having trouble following simple commands. Personality or behavior changes. Seizures, especially if there is no history of seizures. Hearing problems. Dizziness or a sense that the world is spinning, also called vertigo. Feeling very hungry and gaining weight. Brain tumor that aren't cancerous tend to cause symptom that develop slowly. Noncancerous brain tumor also are called benign brain tumors. They might cause subtle symptom that you don't notice at first. The symptom might get worse over month or years. Cancerous brain tumor cause symptom that get worse quickly. Cancerous brain tumor also are called brain cancer or malignant brain tumors. They cause symptom that come on suddenly. They get worse in a matter of day or weeks. Brain tumor headache Headaches are the most common symptom of brain tumors. Headaches happen in about half of people with brain tumors. Headaches can happen if a growing brain tumor press on healthy cell around it. Or a brain tumor can cause swelling in the brain that increase pressure in the head and lead to a headache. Headache pain caused by brain tumor is often worse when you wake up in the morning. But it can happen at any time. Some people have headache that wake them from sleep. Brain tumor headache tend to cause pain that's worse when coughing or straining. People with brain tumor most often report that the headache feel like a tension headache. Some people say the headache feel like a migraine. Brain tumor in the back of the head might cause a headache with neck pain.

"A benign peripheral nerve tumor can cause symptom if it press on the nerve in which it is growing or on nearby nerves, blood vessel or tissues. As the tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause symptoms, but even small tumor can sometimes cause symptoms. Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor and which tissue it affects. Symptoms may include: Swelling or a lump under your skin Pain, tingling or numbness Weakness or loss of function in the affected area Dizziness or loss of balance Causes The cause of benign peripheral nerve tumor usually isn't known. Some are passed down in families. The most common type of benign peripheral nerve tumor is a schwannoma. A schwannoma typically start in a single bundle inside the main nerve, shifting the rest of the nerve. Another common type is a neurofibroma. A neurofibroma also often form inside the nerve. Sometimes it grows from several nerve bundles. Perineuriomas are rare and can grow from inside or outside the nerve. Tumors outside a nerve can cause problem when they press on the nerve. Other benign tumor that form outside nerve are soft lump of slow-growing fat cell called lipoma and ganglion cysts.

"Signs and symptom of sickle cell anemia usually appear around 6 month of age. They vary from person to person and may change over time. Signs and symptom can include: Anemia. Sickle cell break apart easily and die. Red blood cell usually live for about 120 day before they need to be replaced. But sickle cell typically die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cell (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, the body can't get enough oxygen and this cause fatigue. Episodes of pain. Periodic episode of extreme pain, called pain crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cell block blood flow through tiny blood vessel to your chest, abdomen and joints. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hour to a few days. Some people have only a few pain crisis a year. Others have a dozen or more a year. A severe pain crisis requires a hospital stay. Some adolescent and adult with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers, and other causes. Swelling of hand and feet. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cell blocking blood circulation in the hand and feet. Frequent infections. Sickle cell can damage the spleen, increasing vulnerability to infections. Infants and child with sickle cell anemia commonly receive vaccination and antibiotic to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such a pneumonia. Delayed growth or puberty. Red blood cell provide the body with the oxygen and nutrient needed for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cell can slow growth in infant and child and delay puberty in teenagers. Vision problems. Tiny blood vessel that supply the eye can become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the retina — the portion of the eye that process visual image — and lead to vision problems.",907,Sickle Cell Anemia

"Heart disease symptom depend on the type of heart disease. Symptoms of heart disease in the blood vessel Coronary artery disease is a common heart condition that affect the major blood vessel that supply the heart muscle. Cholesterol deposit (plaques) in the heart artery are usually the cause of coronary artery disease. The buildup of these plaque is called atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis). Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow to the heart and other part of the body. It can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Coronary artery disease symptom may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other symptom along with chest discomfort, such a shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue. Symptoms of coronary artery disease can include: Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina) Shortness of breath Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly area or back Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the leg or arm if the blood vessel in those body area are narrowed You might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure.

Show transcript for video What is coronary artery disease? A Mayo Clinic cardiologist explains. {Music playing} Stephen Kopecky, M.D., Cardiovascular Disease, Mayo Clinic: I'm Dr. Stephen Kopecky, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic. In this video, we'll cover the basic of coronary artery disease. What is it? Who get it? The symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Whether you're looking for answer for yourself or someone you love, we're here to give you the best information available. Coronary artery disease, also called CAD, is a condition that affect your heart. It is the most common heart disease in the United States. CAD happens when coronary artery struggle to supply the heart with enough blood, oxygen and nutrients. Cholesterol deposits, or plaques, are almost always to blame. These buildup narrow your arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath or even a heart attack. CAD typically take a long time to develop. So often, patient don't know that they have it until there's a problem. But there are way to prevent coronary artery disease, and way to know if you're at risk and way to treat it. Who get it? Anyone can develop CAD. It begin when fats, cholesterol and other substance gather along the wall of your arteries. This process is called atherosclerosis. It's typically no cause for concern. However, too much buildup can lead to a blockage, obstructing blood flow. There are a number of risk factors, common red flags, that can contribute to this and ultimately lead to coronary artery disease. First, getting older can mean more damaged and narrowed arteries. Second, men are generally at a greater risk. But the risk for woman increase after menopause. Existing health condition matter, too. High blood pressure can thicken your arteries, narrowing your blood flow. High cholesterol level can increase the rate of plaque buildup.

Whether you're looking for answer for yourself or someone you love, we're here to give you the best information available. Coronary artery disease, also called CAD, is a condition that affect your heart. It is the most common heart disease in the United States. CAD happens when coronary artery struggle to supply the heart with enough blood, oxygen and nutrients. Cholesterol deposits, or plaques, are almost always to blame. These buildup narrow your arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath or even a heart attack. CAD typically take a long time to develop. So often, patient don't know that they have it until there's a problem. But there are way to prevent coronary artery disease, and way to know if you're at risk and way to treat it. Who get it? Anyone can develop CAD. It begin when fats, cholesterol and other substance gather along the wall of your arteries. This process is called atherosclerosis. It's typically no cause for concern. However, too much buildup can lead to a blockage, obstructing blood flow. There are a number of risk factors, common red flags, that can contribute to this and ultimately lead to coronary artery disease. First, getting older can mean more damaged and narrowed arteries. Second, men are generally at a greater risk. But the risk for woman increase after menopause. Existing health condition matter, too. High blood pressure can thicken your arteries, narrowing your blood flow. High cholesterol level can increase the rate of plaque buildup.

They open and close to move blood through the heart. Many thing can damage the heart valves. A heart valve may become narrowed (stenosis), leaky (regurgitation or insufficiency) or close improperly (prolapse). Valvular heart disease is also called heart valve disease. Depending on which valve isn't working properly, heart valve disease symptom generally include: Chest pain Fainting (syncope) Fatigue Irregular heartbeat Shortness of breath Swollen foot or ankle Endocarditis is an infection that affect the heart valve and inner lining of the heart chamber and heart valve (endocardium).

Because alcohol poisoning affect the way the gag reflex works, someone with alcohol poisoning may choke on his or her own vomit and not be able to breathe. While waiting for help, don't try to make the person vomit because he or she could choke. Help a person who is vomiting. Try to keep him or her sitting up. If the person must lie down, make sure to turn his or her head to the side — this help prevent choking. Try to keep the person awake to prevent loss of consciousness.

"Throughout the menopausal transition, some subtle — and some not-so-subtle — change in your body may take place. You might experience: Irregular periods. As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the length of time between period may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If you have a persistent change of seven day or more in the length of your menstrual cycle, you may be in early perimenopause. If you have a space of 60 day or more between periods, you're likely in late perimenopause. Hot flash and sleep problems. Hot flash are common during perimenopause.

Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause. The cause of these symptom may be sleep disruption associated with hot flashes. Mood change may also be caused by factor not related to the hormonal change of perimenopause. Vaginal and bladder problems.

Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence. Decreasing fertility. As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. However, a long a you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you've had no period for 12 months. Changes in sexual function. During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. But if you had satisfactory sexual intimacy before menopause, this will likely continue through perimenopause and beyond. Loss of bone. With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis — a disease that cause fragile bones. Changing cholesterol levels. Declining estrogen level may lead to unfavorable change in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the ""bad"" cholesterol — which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol — the ""good"" cholesterol — decrease in many woman a they age, which also increase the risk of heart disease.",739,Perimenopause

"The main sign of FAP is hundred or even thousand of polyp growing in your colon and rectum, usually starting by your mid-teens. The polyp are nearly 100 percent certain to develop into colon cancer or rectal cancer by the time you're in your 40s. Causes Familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by a defect in a gene that's usually inherited from a parent. But some people develop the abnormal gene that cause the condition. Risk factor Your risk of familial adenomatous polyposis is higher if you have a parent, child, brother, or sister with the condition. Complications In addition to colon cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis can cause other complications: Duodenal polyps. These polyp grow in the upper part of your small intestine and may become cancerous. But with careful monitoring, duodenal polyp can often be detected and removed before cancer develops. Periampullary polyps. These polyp occur where the bile and pancreas duct enter the duodenum (ampulla). Periampullary polyp might become cancerous but can often be detected and removed before cancer develops. Gastric fundic polyps. These polyp grow in the lining of your stomach. Desmoids. These noncancerous mass can arise anywhere in the body but often develop in the stomach area (abdomen). Desmoids can cause serious problem if they grow into nerve or blood vessel or exert pressure on other organ in your body. Other cancers. Rarely, FAP can cause cancer to develop in your thyroid gland, central nervous system, adrenal glands, liver or other organs. Noncancerous (benign) skin tumors. Benign bone growth (osteomas). Congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). These are benign pigment change in the retina of your eye. Dental abnormalities. These include extra teeth or teeth that don't come in. Low number of red blood cell (anemia). Prevention Preventing FAP is not possible, since it is an inherited genetic condition. However, if you or your child is at risk of FAP because of a family member with the condition, you will need genetic testing and counseling. If you have FAP, you will need regular screening, followed by surgery if needed. Surgery can help prevent the development of colorectal cancer or other complications.

"The sign and symptom of hypopituitarism usually develop gradually and get worse over time. They are sometimes subtle and may be overlooked for month or even years. But for some people, sign and symptom develop suddenly. Signs and symptom of hypopituitarism vary from person to person, depending on which pituitary hormone are affected and to what degree. In people who have more than one pituitary hormone deficiency, the second deficiency may increase or, in some cases, hide the symptom of the first deficiency. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency In children, GH deficiency may cause growth problem and short stature. Most adult who have GH deficiency don't have any symptoms, but for some adult it can cause: GH GH Fatigue Muscle weakness Changes in body fat composition Lack of ambition Social isolation Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiency Deficiency of these hormones, called gonadotropins, affect the reproductive system. In women, the deficiency decrease egg and estrogen production from the ovaries. In men, the deficiency decrease sperm and testosterone production from the testicles. Women and men may experience a lower sex drive, infertility or fatigue. In child and adolescents, delayed puberty is usually the only symptom. Women may also have symptom such as: Hot flash Irregular or no period Loss of pubic hair An inability to produce milk for breast-feeding Men may also have symptom such as: Erectile dysfunction Decreased facial or body hair Mood change Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency This hormone control the thyroid gland.

Symptoms tend to be worse at night when it's dark and thing look le familiar. They also tend to be worse in setting that aren't familiar, such a in a hospital. Primary symptom include the following.

Dementia usually begin with minor symptom that get worse over time. Attention. The ability to stay focused or maintain focus is impaired with delirium. A person in the early stage of dementia remains generally alert. Someone with dementia often isn't sluggish or agitated. Rapid change in symptoms.

"There are three general type of thoracic outlet syndrome: Neurogenic (neurologic) thoracic outlet syndrome. This most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome is characterized by compression of the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is a network of nerve that come from your spinal cord and control muscle movement and sensation in your shoulder, arm and hand. Venous thoracic outlet syndrome. This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one or more of the vein under the collarbone (clavicle) are compressed, resulting in blood clots. Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the least common type of TOS. It occurs when one of the artery under the collarbone is compressed, resulting in bulging of the artery, also known a an aneurysm. It's possible to have a mix of the three different type of thoracic outlet syndrome, with multiple part of the thoracic outlet being compressed. Thoracic outlet syndrome symptom can vary depending on the type. When nerve are compressed, sign and symptom of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include: Numbness or tingling in your arm or finger Pain or ache in your neck, shoulder, arm or hand Weakening grip Signs and symptom of venous thoracic outlet syndrome can include: Discoloration of your hand (bluish color) Arm pain and swelling Blood clot in vein in the upper area of your body Arm fatigue with activity Paleness or abnormal color in one or more finger or your hand Throbbing lump near your collarbone Signs and symptom of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome can include: Cold fingers, hand or arm Hand and arm pain Lack of color (pallor) or bluish discoloration (cyanosis) in one or more of your finger or your entire hand Weak or no pulse in the affected arm",981,Thoracic Outlet Syndrome

"A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue. A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material. Examples of jaw tumor and cyst include: Ameloblastoma. This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begin in the cell that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumor and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence. Central giant cell granuloma. Central giant cell granuloma are benign lesion that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumor can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and ha a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is le aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on it own, but typically these tumor require surgical treatment. Dentigerous cyst. This cyst originates from tissue that surround a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affect the jaws. Most often these cyst will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth. Odontogenic keratocyst. This cyst is also referred to a a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of it tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cyst may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Odontogenic myxoma. This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxoma are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chance of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive form of surgical treatment. Odontoma. This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumor may be part of some genetic syndromes. Other type of cyst and tumors. These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others.",542,Jaw Tumors Cysts

Omphalopagus (om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) twin are joined near the bellybutton. Many omphalopagus twin share the liver and some part of the upper digestive (gastrointestinal or GI) tract. Some twin share the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and the longest part of the large intestine (colon). They generally do not share a heart. Base of spine.

Craniopagus twin share a portion of the skull. But their brain are usually separate, though they may share some brain tissue. Head and chest. Cephalopagus (sef-uh-LOP-uh-gus) twin are joined at the head and upper body. The face are on opposite side of a single shared head, and they share a brain. These twin rarely survive. In rare cases, twin may be conjoined with one twin smaller and le fully formed than the other (asymmetric conjoined twins).

"Schizophrenia involves a range of problem with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions. Signs and symptom may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucination or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include: Delusions. These are false belief that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; certain gesture or comment are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing thing that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voice is the most common hallucination.

"Adults and child who have familial hypercholesterolemia have very high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in their blood. LDL cholesterol is known a ""bad"" cholesterol because it can build up in the wall of the arteries, making them hard and narrow. LDL This excess cholesterol is sometimes deposited in certain portion of the skin, some tendon and around the iris of the eyes: Skin. The most common spot for cholesterol deposit to occur is on the hands, elbow and knees. They also can occur in the skin around the eyes. Tendons. Cholesterol deposit may thicken the Achilles tendon, along with some tendon in the hands. Eyes. High cholesterol level can cause corneal arcus, a white or gray ring around the iris of the eye. This happens most commonly in older people, but it can occur in younger people who have familial hypercholesterolemia. Causes Familial hypercholesterolemia is caused by a gene alteration that's passed down from one or both parents. People who have this condition are born with it. This change prevents the body from ridding itself of the type of cholesterol that can build up in the artery and cause heart disease. Risk factor The risk of familial hypercholesterolemia is higher if one or both of your parent have the gene alteration that cause it. Most people who have the condition receive one affected gene. But in rare cases, a child can get the affected gene from both parents. This can cause a more severe form of the condition. Familial hypercholesterolemia may be more common in certain populations, including: Ashkenazi Jews Some Lebanese group French Canadians Complications People who have familial hypercholesterolemia have a higher risk of heart disease and death at a younger age. Heart attack may occur before age 50 in men and age 60 in women. The rarer and more severe variety of the condition, if undiagnosed or untreated, can cause death before age 20.

For instance, the gastrointestinal system and bone marrow are highly sensitive to radiation. Initial sign and symptom The initial sign and symptom of treatable radiation sickness are usually nausea and vomiting. The amount of time between exposure and when these symptom develop is a clue to how much radiation a person ha absorbed. After the first round of sign and symptoms, a person with radiation sickness may have a brief period with no apparent illness, followed by the onset of new, more-serious symptoms.

When people with lung cavity are also infected with aspergillus, fungus fiber may find their way into the cavity and grow into tangled mass (fungus balls) known a aspergillomas. Aspergillomas may produce no symptom or cause only a mild cough at first. Over time and without treatment, however, aspergillomas can worsen the underlying chronic lung condition and possibly cause: A cough that often brings up blood (hemoptysis) Wheezing Shortness of breath Unintentional weight loss Fatigue Invasive aspergillosis This is the most severe form of aspergillosis. It occurs when the infection spread rapidly from the lung to the brain, heart, kidney or skin.

They also may cause sudden sensory symptom such a tingling, dizziness and seeing flashing lights. Symptoms of focal seizure may be confused with other disorder of the brain or nervous system. They include migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. Generalized seizure Seizures that appear to involve all area of the brain from the time they start are called generalized seizures. Different type of generalized seizure include: Absence seizures. Absence seizures, formerly known a petit mal seizures, often occur in children.

Myoclonic seizure usually appear a sudden brief jerk or twitch of the arm and legs. There is often no loss of consciousness. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known a grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause a sudden loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking. They sometimes cause people to lose control of their bladder or to bite their tongue. They may last for several minutes. Tonic-clonic seizure also may start a focal seizure that then spread to involve most or all of the brain.",894,Seizure

"Not all pituitary tumor cause symptoms. Sometimes these tumor are found during an imaging test, such a an MRI or a CT scan, that is done for another reason. If they don't cause symptoms, pituitary tumor usually don't need treatment. MRI CT Pituitary tumor symptom may be caused by a tumor putting pressure on the brain or on other part of the body nearby. Symptoms also can be caused by a hormone imbalance. Hormone level can rise when a pituitary tumor make too much of one or more hormones. Or a large tumor that disrupts the way the pituitary gland work may cause hormone level to fall. Symptoms from tumor pressure Macroadenomas can put pressure on the pituitary gland, on nerves, on the brain and on other part of the body nearby. That can cause symptom such as: Headache. Eye problem due to pressure on the optic nerve, especially loss of side vision, also called peripheral vision, and double vision. Pain in the face, sometimes including sinus pain or ear pain. Drooping eyelid. Seizures. Nausea and vomiting.

Low amount of hormone Macroadenomas can limit the pituitary gland's ability to make hormones. When that happens, symptom may include: Tiredness or weakness. Lack of energy. Sexual problems, such a problem with erection and le interest in sex. Changes in menstrual cycles. Nausea. Feeling cold. Losing or gaining weight without trying. High amount of hormone Functioning pituitary adenoma typically make a large amount of one hormone. That expose the body to high level of that hormone. Rarely, a pituitary adenoma may make more than one hormone. The following type of functioning pituitary adenoma cause different symptom depending on the hormone they make. Pituitary tumor that make adrenocorticotropic hormone Pituitary tumor that make adrenocorticotropic hormone are called corticotroph adenomas. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, also called ACTH, cause the adrenal gland to make the hormone cortisol. ACTH tumor trigger the adrenal gland to make too much cortisol. This cause a condition called Cushing disease. Cushing disease is one cause of Cushing syndrome. ACTH ACTH Cushing disease symptom include: Weight gain and fatty tissue deposit around the midsection and upper back. Rounded face. Stretch marks. Thin skin that bruise easily. Thinning of the arm and leg with muscle weakness. Thicker or more visible body hair. Slow healing of cuts, insect bite and infections. Areas of darkened skin. Acne. Changes in menstrual cycles. Sexual problems, including problem with erection and le interest in sex. Pituitary tumor that make growth hormone Pituitary tumor that make growth hormone also are called growth hormone-secreting tumor or somatotroph adenomas. Too much growth hormone lead to a condition known a acromegaly. Acromegaly can cause: Changes in facial features, including larger lips, nose and tongue; longer lower jaw; and wide space between teeth. Growth of hand and feet. Thicker skin. More sweating and body odor. Joint pain. A deeper voice. Children and teen who have too much growth hormone might also grow faster or taller than usual. This condition is called gigantism. Pituitary tumor that make luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are also known a gonadotropins. Pituitary tumor that make these hormone are called gonadotroph adenomas. It's uncommon for these adenoma to make too many hormone that then trigger symptoms. Instead, symptom from these adenoma usually are due to tumor pressure. If symptom do happen because of too much LH and FSH, they affect woman and men differently. LH FSH Symptoms in woman may include: Change in menstrual cycles. Fertility problems. Enlargement of and pain in the ovary caused by a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Symptoms in men may include: Enlarged testicles. Higher level of testosterone. Pituitary tumor that make prolactin These adenoma are called prolactinomas. Too much of the hormone prolactin can lead to a decrease in the body's level of sex hormone — estrogen and testosterone. Too much prolactin affect men and woman differently. In women, too much prolactin might cause: Irregular menstrual cycles. Lack of menstrual cycles. Milky discharge from the breasts. Breast tenderness. Problems with fertility. Less interest in sex. In men, too much prolactin can cause a condition called male hypogonadism. Symptoms might include: Problems with erections. Less interest in sex. Breast growth. Problems with fertility. Less body and facial hair. Pituitary tumor that make thyroid-stimulating hormone Pituitary tumor that make thyroid-stimulating hormone are called thyrotroph adenomas. They also may be referred to a thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting tumors. They cause the thyroid gland to make too much of the hormone thyroxine, also called T-4. That lead to a condition called hyperthyroidism, also known a overactive thyroid disease. Hyperthyroidism can speed up the body's metabolism causing many symptoms. Some of the most common include: Weight loss. Rapid or irregular heartbeat. Nervousness, anxiety or irritability. Frequent bowel movements. Sweating. Tremor. Sleep problems.",758,Pituitary Tumors

"Signs and symptom of Noonan syndrome vary greatly among individual and may be mild to severe. Characteristics may be related to the specific gene containing the mutation. Facial feature Facial appearance is one of the key clinical feature that lead to a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. These feature may be more pronounced in infant and young children, but change with age. In adulthood, these distinct feature become more subtle. Features may include the following: Eyes are wide-set and down-slanting with droopy lids. Irises are pale blue or green. Ears are low-set and rotated backward. Nose is depressed at the top, with a wide base and bulbous tip. Mouth ha a deep groove between the nose and the mouth and wide peak in the upper lip. The crease that run from the edge of the nose to the corner of the mouth becomes deeply grooved with age. Teeth may be crooked, the inside roof of the mouth (palate) may be highly arched and the lower jaw may be small. Facial feature may appear coarse, but appear sharper with age. The face may appear droopy and expressionless. Head may appear large with a prominent forehead and a low hairline on the back of the head. Skin may appear thin and transparent with age. Heart disease Many people with Noonan syndrome are born with some form of heart defect (congenital heart disease), accounting for some of the key sign and symptom of the disorder. Some heart problem can occur later in life. Some form of congenital heart disease associated with this disorder include: Valve disorders. Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve, the flap of tissue that separate the lower right chamber (ventricle) of the heart from the artery that supply blood to the lung (pulmonary artery). It's the most common heart problem seen with Noonan syndrome, and it may occur alone or with other heart defects. Thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). This is abnormal growth or thickening of the heart muscle that affect some people with Noonan syndrome. Other structural defect of the heart. The defect can involve a hole in the wall that separate the two lower chamber of the heart (ventricular septal defect), narrowing of the artery that carry blood to the lung for oxygen (pulmonary artery stenosis), or narrowing of the major blood vessel (aorta) that carry blood from the heart to the body (aortic coarctation). Irregular heart rhythm. This can occur with or without structural heart abnormalities. Irregular heart rhythm occurs in the majority of people with Noonan syndrome. Growth issue Noonan syndrome can affect normal growth. Many child with Noonan syndrome don't grow at a normal rate. Issues may include the following: Birth weight will likely be normal, but growth slows over time. Eating difficulty may result in inadequate nutrition and poor weight gain. Growth hormone level may be insufficient. The growth spurt that's usually seen during the teenage year may be delayed. But because this disorder cause bone maturity to be delayed, growth sometimes continues into the late teens. By adulthood, some people with Noonan syndrome may have normal height, but short stature is more common. Musculoskeletal issue Some common issue can include: An unusually shaped chest often with a sunken sternum (pectus excavatum) or raised sternum (pectus carinatum) Wide-set nipple Short neck, often with extra fold of skin (webbed neck) or prominent neck muscle (trapezius) Deformities of the spine Learning disability Intelligence isn't affected for most people with Noonan syndrome. However, individual may have: An increased risk of learning disability and mild intellectual disability A wide range of mental, emotional and behavioral issue that are usually mild Hearing and vision deficit that may complicate learning Eye condition A common sign of Noonan syndrome is abnormality of the eye and eyelids. These may include: Problems with the eye muscles, such a cross-eye (strabismus) Refractive problems, such a astigmatism, nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) Rapid movement of the eyeball (nystagmus) Cataracts Hearing problem Noonan syndrome can cause hearing deficit due to nerve issue or to structural abnormality in the inner ear bones. Bleeding Noonan syndrome can cause excessive bleeding and bruising due to clotting defect or having too few platelets. Lymphatic condition Noonan syndrome can cause problem with the lymphatic system, which drain excess fluid from the body and help fight infection. These problems: May show up before or after birth or develop in the teenage year or adulthood Can be focused in a particular area of the body or widespread Most commonly cause excess fluid (lymphedema) on the back of the hand or top of the foot Genital and kidney condition Many people, especially males, with Noonan syndrome can have problem with the genitals and kidneys. Testicles. Undescended testicle (cryptorchidism) are common in males. Puberty. Puberty may be delayed in both boy and girls. Fertility. Most female develop normal fertility. In males, however, fertility may not develop normally, often because of undescended testicles. Kidneys. Kidney problem are generally mild and occur in a fairly small number of people with Noonan syndrome. Skin condition People with Noonan syndrome may have skin conditions, which most commonly are: Various problem that affect the color and texture of the skin Curly, coarse hair or sparse hair When to see a doctor The sign and symptom of Noonan syndrome can be subtle. If you suspect you or your child may have the disorder, see your primary care doctor or your child's pediatrician. You or your child may be referred to a geneticist or a cardiologist. If your unborn child is at risk because of a family history of Noonan syndrome, prenatal test may be available.",687,Noonan Syndrome

"A child who's being abused may feel guilty, ashamed or confused. The child may be afraid to tell anyone about the abuse, especially if the abuser is a parent, other relative or family friend. That's why it's vital to watch for red flags, such as: Withdrawal from friend or usual activity Changes in behavior — such a aggression, anger, hostility or hyperactivity — or change in school performance Depression, anxiety or unusual fears, or a sudden loss of self-confidence Sleep problem and nightmare An apparent lack of supervision Frequent absence from school Rebellious or defiant behavior Self-harm or attempt at suicide Specific sign and symptom depend on the type of abuse and can vary. Keep in mind that warning sign are just that — warning signs. The presence of warning sign doesn't necessarily mean that a child is being abused.

While parent and caregiver often use physical punishment with the intention of helping their child or making their behavior better, research show that spanking is linked with worse, not better, behavior. It's also linked to mental health problems, difficult relationship with parents, lower self-esteem and lower academic performance. Any physical punishment may leave emotional scars. Parental behavior that cause pain, physical injury or emotional trauma — even when done in the name of discipline — could be child abuse.",196,Child Abuse

"Although your body can harbor the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, your immune system usually can prevent you from becoming sick. For this reason, doctor make a distinction between: Latent TB. You have a TB infection, but the bacteria in your body are inactive and cause no symptoms. Latent TB, also called inactive TB or TB infection, isn't contagious. Latent TB can turn into active TB, so treatment is important. Active TB. Also called TB disease, this condition make you sick and, in most cases, can spread to others. It can occur week or year after infection with the TB bacteria. Signs and symptom of active TB include: TB Coughing for three or more week Coughing up blood or mucus Chest pain, or pain with breathing or coughing Unintentional weight loss Fatigue Fever Night sweat Chills Loss of appetite Tuberculosis can also affect other part of your body, including the kidneys, spine or brain.

"The sign of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they become more apparent during the first few month of your baby's life. Signs and severity depend on how many suture are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. Signs and symptom can include: A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the suture are affected Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, with a change in the shape of the head that's not typical Types of craniosynostosis There are several type of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex form of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Multiple suture craniosynostosis is usually linked to genetic syndrome and is called syndromic craniosynostosis. The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what suture are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include: Sagittal (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that run from the front to the back at the top of the skull force the head to grow long and narrow. This head shape is called scaphocephaly. Sagittal craniosynostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Coronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal suture (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also lead to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal suture fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head ha a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward. Metopic. The metopic suture run from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion give the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This head shape is also called trigonocephaly. Lambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which run along the back of the head. It may cause one side of a baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side. Other reason for a misshapen head A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time lying on one side of the head. This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more balanced appearance.",253,Craniosynostosis

PKU Classic PKU. The most severe form of the disorder is called classic PKU. The enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine is missing or severely reduced. This result in high level of phenylalanine that can cause severe brain damage. Less severe form of PKU. In mild or moderate forms, the enzyme still ha some function, so phenylalanine level are not a high, resulting in a smaller risk of significant brain damage. Regardless of the form, most infants, child and adult with the disorder still require a special PKU diet to prevent intellectual disability and other complications. PKU Pregnancy and PKU Women who have PKU and become pregnant are at risk of another form of the condition called maternal PKU. If woman don't follow the special PKU diet before and during pregnancy, blood phenylalanine level can become high and harm the developing baby. PKU PKU PKU Even woman with le severe form of PKU may place their unborn child at risk by not following the PKU diet. PKU PKU Babies born to woman with high phenylalanine level don't often inherit PKU. But a child can have serious problem if the level of phenylalanine is high in the mother's blood during pregnancy. At birth, the baby may have: PKU Low birth weight Unusually small head Problems with the heart In addition, maternal PKU can cause the child to have delayed development, intellectual disability and problem with behavior.",752,Phenylketonuria

This is called early localized disease. A rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spread from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feel warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy. A rash Other stage 1 symptom include: Fever. Headache. Extreme tiredness. Joint stiffness. Muscle ache and pains. Swollen lymph nodes. Stage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse. The symptom often show up within 3 to 10 week after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease. Stage 2 may include the stage 1 symptom and the following: Many rash on other part of the body. Neck pain or stiffness. Muscle weakness on one or both side of the face. Immune-system activity in heart tissue that cause irregular heartbeats. Pain that start from the back and hip and spread to the legs. Pain, numbness or weakness in the hand or feet. Painful swelling in tissue of the eye or eyelid. Immune-system activity in eye nerve that cause pain or vision loss. Stage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptom from the earlier stage and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease. In the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time.

"There are three type of neurofibromatosis, each with different sign and symptoms. Neurofibromatosis 1 Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is usually diagnosed during childhood. Signs are often noticeable at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Signs and symptom are often mild to moderate, but can vary in severity. Signs and symptom include: Flat, light brown spot on the skin (cafe au lait spots). These harmless spot are common in many people. Having more than six cafe au lait spot suggests NF1. They are usually present at birth or appear during the first year of life. After childhood, new spot stop appearing. Freckling in the armpit or groin area. Freckling usually appears by age 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spot and tend to occur in cluster in skin folds. Tiny bump on the iris of the eye (Lisch nodules). These harmless nodule can't easily be seen and don't affect vision. Soft, pea-sized bump on or under the skin (neurofibromas). These benign tumor usually develop in or under the skin, but can also grow inside the body. Sometimes, a growth will involve many nerve (plexiform neurofibroma). Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age. Bone deformities. Abnormal bone development and a deficiency in bone mineral density can cause bone deformity such a a curved spine (scoliosis) or a bowed lower leg. Tumor on the optic nerve (optic glioma). These tumor usually appear by age 3, rarely in late childhood and adolescence, and almost never in adults. Learning disabilities. Impaired thinking skill are common in child who have NF1 but are usually mild. Often there is a specific learning disability, such a a problem with reading or mathematics. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common. Larger than average head size. Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume. Short stature. Children who have NF1 often are below average in height. Neurofibromatosis 2 Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is much le common than NF1. Signs and symptom of NF2 usually result from the development of benign, slow-growing tumor in both ear (acoustic neuromas), which can cause hearing loss. Also known a vestibular schwannomas, these tumor grow on the nerve that carry sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. NF1 NF2 Signs and symptom generally appear during the late teen and early adult years, and can vary in severity. Signs and symptom can include: Gradual hearing loss Ringing in the ear Poor balance Headaches Sometimes NF2 can lead to the growth of schwannomas in other nerves, including the cranial, spinal, visual (optic) and peripheral nerves. People who have NF2 may also develop other benign tumors. NF2 NF2 Signs and symptom of these tumor can include: Numbness and weakness in the arm or leg Pain Balance difficulty Facial drop Vision problem or cataract Seizures Headache Schwannomatosis This rare type of neurofibromatosis usually affect people after age 20. Symptoms usually appear between age 25 and 30. Schwannomatosis cause tumor to develop on the cranial, spinal and peripheral nerve — but rarely on the nerve that carry sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Tumors don't usually grow on both hearing nerves, so people who have schwannomatosis don't experience the same hearing loss a people who have NF2. NF2 Symptoms of schwannomatosis include: Chronic pain, which can occur anywhere in the body and can be disabling Numbness or weakness in various part of the body Loss of muscle",679,Neurofibromatosis

"Gender dysphoria might cause adolescent and adult to experience a marked difference between inner gender identity and assigned gender that last for at least six months. The difference is shown by at least two of the following: A difference between gender identity and genitals or secondary sex characteristics, such a breast size, voice and facial hair. In young adolescents, a difference between gender identity and anticipated secondary sex characteristics. A strong desire to be rid of these genitals or secondary sex characteristics, or a desire to prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics. A strong desire to have the genitals and secondary sex characteristic of another gender. A strong desire to be or to be treated a another gender. A strong belief of having the typical feeling and reaction of another gender.

Gender dysphoria might start in childhood and continue into adolescence and adulthood. Or you might have period in which you no longer experience gender dysphoria. You might also experience gender dysphoria around the time of puberty or much later in life. Complications Gender dysphoria can affect many aspect of life, including daily activities. People experiencing gender dysphoria might have difficulty in school due to pressure to dress in a way that's associated with their sex assigned at birth or out of fear of being harassed or teased. If gender dysphoria impairs the ability to function at school or at work, the result may be school dropout or unemployment. Relationship difficulty are common. Anxiety, depression, self-harm, eating disorders, substance misuse and other problem can occur. People who have gender dysphoria also often experience discrimination, resulting in stress. Accessing health service and mental health service can be difficult due to fear of stigma and a lack of experienced care providers. Adolescents and adult with gender dysphoria without gender-affirming treatment might be at risk of thinking about or attempting suicide.

The lowest part of your spinal cord that remains undamaged after an injury is referred to a the neurological level of your injury. The severity of the injury is often called ""the completeness"" and is classified a either of the following: Complete. If all feeling (sensory) and all ability to control movement (motor function) are lost below the spinal cord injury, your injury is called complete. Incomplete. If you have some motor or sensory function below the affected area, your injury is called incomplete. There are varying degree of incomplete injury. Additionally, paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as: Tetraplegia. Also known a quadriplegia, this mean that your arms, hands, trunk, leg and pelvic organ are all affected by your spinal cord injury. Paraplegia. This paralysis affect all or part of the trunk, leg and pelvic organs. Your health care team will perform a series of test to determine the neurological level and completeness of your injury.

Even though the digestive tract look normal, it doesn't function a it should. Muscles in the intestine move food from the stomach to the rectum. Normally, they contract and relax in a gentle rhythm that move the food along in a fairly predictable schedule. But with some people, the muscle in the intestine spasm. That mean the contraction are longer and stronger than normal. Those spasm are painful. They also disrupt the movement of food through the intestines. If they slow it down, you become constipated. If they cause it to move through too quickly, you get diarrhea. It's not unusual for people to alternate between the two. Another cause of discomfort for people with IBS result from oversensitive nerve ending in the digestive tract. Small bubble of gas that wouldn't bother most people might be quite painful for you. Your heightened sensitivity can also lead to swelling and bloating.",538,Irritable Bowel Syndrome
