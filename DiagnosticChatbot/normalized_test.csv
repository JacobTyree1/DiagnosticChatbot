"The sign and symptom of hypopituitarism usually develop gradually and get worse over time. They are sometimes subtle and may be overlooked for month or even years. But for some people, sign and symptom develop suddenly. Signs and symptom of hypopituitarism vary from person to person, depending on which pituitary hormone are affected and to what degree. In people who have more than one pituitary hormone deficiency, the second deficiency may increase or, in some cases, hide the symptom of the first deficiency. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency In children, GH deficiency may cause growth problem and short stature. Most adult who have GH deficiency don't have any symptoms, but for some adult it can cause: GH GH Fatigue Muscle weakness Changes in body fat composition Lack of ambition Social isolation Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiency Deficiency of these hormones, called gonadotropins, affect the reproductive system. In women, the deficiency decrease egg and estrogen production from the ovaries. In men, the deficiency decrease sperm and testosterone production from the testicles. Women and men may experience a lower sex drive, infertility or fatigue. In child and adolescents, delayed puberty is usually the only symptom.

"There are three general type of thoracic outlet syndrome: Neurogenic (neurologic) thoracic outlet syndrome. This most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome is characterized by compression of the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is a network of nerve that come from your spinal cord and control muscle movement and sensation in your shoulder, arm and hand. Venous thoracic outlet syndrome. This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one or more of the vein under the collarbone (clavicle) are compressed, resulting in blood clots. Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the least common type of TOS. It occurs when one of the artery under the collarbone is compressed, resulting in bulging of the artery, also known a an aneurysm. It's possible to have a mix of the three different type of thoracic outlet syndrome, with multiple part of the thoracic outlet being compressed. Thoracic outlet syndrome symptom can vary depending on the type. When nerve are compressed, sign and symptom of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include: Numbness or tingling in your arm or finger Pain or ache in your neck, shoulder, arm or hand Weakening grip Signs and symptom of venous thoracic outlet syndrome can include: Discoloration of your hand (bluish color) Arm pain and swelling Blood clot in vein in the upper area of your body Arm fatigue with activity Paleness or abnormal color in one or more finger or your hand Throbbing lump near your collarbone Signs and symptom of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome can include: Cold fingers, hand or arm Hand and arm pain Lack of color (pallor) or bluish discoloration (cyanosis) in one or more of your finger or your entire hand Weak or no pulse in the affected arm",981,Thoracic Outlet Syndrome

"A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue. A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material. Examples of jaw tumor and cyst include: Ameloblastoma. This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begin in the cell that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumor and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence. Central giant cell granuloma. Central giant cell granuloma are benign lesion that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumor can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and ha a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is le aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on it own, but typically these tumor require surgical treatment. Dentigerous cyst. This cyst originates from tissue that surround a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affect the jaws. Most often these cyst will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth. Odontogenic keratocyst. This cyst is also referred to a a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of it tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cyst may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Odontogenic myxoma. This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxoma are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chance of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive form of surgical treatment. Odontoma. This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumor may be part of some genetic syndromes. Other type of cyst and tumors. These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others.",542,Jaw Tumors Cysts

Omphalopagus (om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) twin are joined near the bellybutton. Many omphalopagus twin share the liver and some part of the upper digestive (gastrointestinal or GI) tract. Some twin share the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and the longest part of the large intestine (colon). They generally do not share a heart. Base of spine.

Craniopagus twin share a portion of the skull. But their brain are usually separate, though they may share some brain tissue. Head and chest. Cephalopagus (sef-uh-LOP-uh-gus) twin are joined at the head and upper body. The face are on opposite side of a single shared head, and they share a brain. These twin rarely survive. In rare cases, twin may be conjoined with one twin smaller and le fully formed than the other (asymmetric conjoined twins).

"Schizophrenia involves a range of problem with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions. Signs and symptom may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucination or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include: Delusions. These are false belief that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; certain gesture or comment are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing thing that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voice is the most common hallucination. Disorganized thinking (speech). Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answer to question may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless word that can't be understood, sometimes known a word salad. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. Negative symptoms.

"Adults and child who have familial hypercholesterolemia have very high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in their blood. LDL cholesterol is known a ""bad"" cholesterol because it can build up in the wall of the arteries, making them hard and narrow. LDL This excess cholesterol is sometimes deposited in certain portion of the skin, some tendon and around the iris of the eyes: Skin. The most common spot for cholesterol deposit to occur is on the hands, elbow and knees. They also can occur in the skin around the eyes. Tendons. Cholesterol deposit may thicken the Achilles tendon, along with some tendon in the hands. Eyes. High cholesterol level can cause corneal arcus, a white or gray ring around the iris of the eye. This happens most commonly in older people, but it can occur in younger people who have familial hypercholesterolemia. Causes Familial hypercholesterolemia is caused by a gene alteration that's passed down from one or both parents. People who have this condition are born with it. This change prevents the body from ridding itself of the type of cholesterol that can build up in the artery and cause heart disease. Risk factor The risk of familial hypercholesterolemia is higher if one or both of your parent have the gene alteration that cause it. Most people who have the condition receive one affected gene. But in rare cases, a child can get the affected gene from both parents. This can cause a more severe form of the condition. Familial hypercholesterolemia may be more common in certain populations, including: Ashkenazi Jews Some Lebanese group French Canadians Complications People who have familial hypercholesterolemia have a higher risk of heart disease and death at a younger age.

Clonic seizure are associated with repeated jerking muscle movements. These seizure usually affect the neck, face and arm on both side of the body. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizure usually appear a sudden brief jerk or twitch of the arm and legs. There is often no loss of consciousness. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known a grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause a sudden loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking. They sometimes cause people to lose control of their bladder or to bite their tongue. They may last for several minutes. Tonic-clonic seizure also may start a focal seizure that then spread to involve most or all of the brain.",894,Seizure

"Not all pituitary tumor cause symptoms. Sometimes these tumor are found during an imaging test, such a an MRI or a CT scan, that is done for another reason. If they don't cause symptoms, pituitary tumor usually don't need treatment. MRI CT Pituitary tumor symptom may be caused by a tumor putting pressure on the brain or on other part of the body nearby. Symptoms also can be caused by a hormone imbalance. Hormone level can rise when a pituitary tumor make too much of one or more hormones. Or a large tumor that disrupts the way the pituitary gland work may cause hormone level to fall. Symptoms from tumor pressure Macroadenomas can put pressure on the pituitary gland, on nerves, on the brain and on other part of the body nearby. That can cause symptom such as: Headache. Eye problem due to pressure on the optic nerve, especially loss of side vision, also called peripheral vision, and double vision. Pain in the face, sometimes including sinus pain or ear pain. Drooping eyelid. Seizures. Nausea and vomiting.

Changes to the face may cause the brow bone and lower jawbone to protrude, and the nose and lip to get larger. Low amount of hormone Macroadenomas can limit the pituitary gland's ability to make hormones. When that happens, symptom may include: Tiredness or weakness. Lack of energy. Sexual problems, such a problem with erection and le interest in sex. Changes in menstrual cycles. Nausea. Feeling cold. Losing or gaining weight without trying. High amount of hormone Functioning pituitary adenoma typically make a large amount of one hormone. That expose the body to high level of that hormone. Rarely, a pituitary adenoma may make more than one hormone. The following type of functioning pituitary adenoma cause different symptom depending on the hormone they make. Pituitary tumor that make adrenocorticotropic hormone Pituitary tumor that make adrenocorticotropic hormone are called corticotroph adenomas. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, also called ACTH, cause the adrenal gland to make the hormone cortisol. ACTH tumor trigger the adrenal gland to make too much cortisol. This cause a condition called Cushing disease. Cushing disease is one cause of Cushing syndrome. ACTH ACTH Cushing disease symptom include: Weight gain and fatty tissue deposit around the midsection and upper back. Rounded face. Stretch marks. Thin skin that bruise easily. Thinning of the arm and leg with muscle weakness. Thicker or more visible body hair. Slow healing of cuts, insect bite and infections. Areas of darkened skin. Acne. Changes in menstrual cycles. Sexual problems, including problem with erection and le interest in sex. Pituitary tumor that make growth hormone Pituitary tumor that make growth hormone also are called growth hormone-secreting tumor or somatotroph adenomas. Too much growth hormone lead to a condition known a acromegaly. Acromegaly can cause: Changes in facial features, including larger lips, nose and tongue; longer lower jaw; and wide space between teeth. Growth of hand and feet. Thicker skin. More sweating and body odor. Joint pain. A deeper voice. Children and teen who have too much growth hormone might also grow faster or taller than usual. This condition is called gigantism. Pituitary tumor that make luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are also known a gonadotropins. Pituitary tumor that make these hormone are called gonadotroph adenomas. It's uncommon for these adenoma to make too many hormone that then trigger symptoms. Instead, symptom from these adenoma usually are due to tumor pressure. If symptom do happen because of too much LH and FSH, they affect woman and men differently. LH FSH Symptoms in woman may include: Change in menstrual cycles. Fertility problems. Enlargement of and pain in the ovary caused by a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Symptoms in men may include: Enlarged testicles. Higher level of testosterone. Pituitary tumor that make prolactin These adenoma are called prolactinomas. Too much of the hormone prolactin can lead to a decrease in the body's level of sex hormone — estrogen and testosterone. Too much prolactin affect men and woman differently. In women, too much prolactin might cause: Irregular menstrual cycles. Lack of menstrual cycles. Milky discharge from the breasts. Breast tenderness. Problems with fertility. Less interest in sex. In men, too much prolactin can cause a condition called male hypogonadism. Symptoms might include: Problems with erections. Less interest in sex. Breast growth. Problems with fertility. Less body and facial hair. Pituitary tumor that make thyroid-stimulating hormone Pituitary tumor that make thyroid-stimulating hormone are called thyrotroph adenomas. They also may be referred to a thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting tumors. They cause the thyroid gland to make too much of the hormone thyroxine, also called T-4. That lead to a condition called hyperthyroidism, also known a overactive thyroid disease. Hyperthyroidism can speed up the body's metabolism causing many symptoms. Some of the most common include: Weight loss. Rapid or irregular heartbeat. Nervousness, anxiety or irritability. Frequent bowel movements. Sweating. Tremor. Sleep problems.",758,Pituitary Tumors

"Signs and symptom of Noonan syndrome vary greatly among individual and may be mild to severe. Characteristics may be related to the specific gene containing the mutation. Facial feature Facial appearance is one of the key clinical feature that lead to a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. These feature may be more pronounced in infant and young children, but change with age. In adulthood, these distinct feature become more subtle. Features may include the following: Eyes are wide-set and down-slanting with droopy lids. Irises are pale blue or green. Ears are low-set and rotated backward. Nose is depressed at the top, with a wide base and bulbous tip. Mouth ha a deep groove between the nose and the mouth and wide peak in the upper lip. The crease that run from the edge of the nose to the corner of the mouth becomes deeply grooved with age. Teeth may be crooked, the inside roof of the mouth (palate) may be highly arched and the lower jaw may be small. Facial feature may appear coarse, but appear sharper with age. The face may appear droopy and expressionless. Head may appear large with a prominent forehead and a low hairline on the back of the head. Skin may appear thin and transparent with age. Heart disease Many people with Noonan syndrome are born with some form of heart defect (congenital heart disease), accounting for some of the key sign and symptom of the disorder. Some heart problem can occur later in life. Some form of congenital heart disease associated with this disorder include: Valve disorders. Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve, the flap of tissue that separate the lower right chamber (ventricle) of the heart from the artery that supply blood to the lung (pulmonary artery). It's the most common heart problem seen with Noonan syndrome, and it may occur alone or with other heart defects. Thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). This is abnormal growth or thickening of the heart muscle that affect some people with Noonan syndrome. Other structural defect of the heart. The defect can involve a hole in the wall that separate the two lower chamber of the heart (ventricular septal defect), narrowing of the artery that carry blood to the lung for oxygen (pulmonary artery stenosis), or narrowing of the major blood vessel (aorta) that carry blood from the heart to the body (aortic coarctation). Irregular heart rhythm. This can occur with or without structural heart abnormalities. Irregular heart rhythm occurs in the majority of people with Noonan syndrome. Growth issue Noonan syndrome can affect normal growth. Many child with Noonan syndrome don't grow at a normal rate. Issues may include the following: Birth weight will likely be normal, but growth slows over time. Eating difficulty may result in inadequate nutrition and poor weight gain. Growth hormone level may be insufficient. The growth spurt that's usually seen during the teenage year may be delayed. But because this disorder cause bone maturity to be delayed, growth sometimes continues into the late teens. By adulthood, some people with Noonan syndrome may have normal height, but short stature is more common. Musculoskeletal issue Some common issue can include: An unusually shaped chest often with a sunken sternum (pectus excavatum) or raised sternum (pectus carinatum) Wide-set nipple Short neck, often with extra fold of skin (webbed neck) or prominent neck muscle (trapezius) Deformities of the spine Learning disability Intelligence isn't affected for most people with Noonan syndrome. However, individual may have: An increased risk of learning disability and mild intellectual disability A wide range of mental, emotional and behavioral issue that are usually mild Hearing and vision deficit that may complicate learning Eye condition A common sign of Noonan syndrome is abnormality of the eye and eyelids. These may include: Problems with the eye muscles, such a cross-eye (strabismus) Refractive problems, such a astigmatism, nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) Rapid movement of the eyeball (nystagmus) Cataracts Hearing problem Noonan syndrome can cause hearing deficit due to nerve issue or to structural abnormality in the inner ear bones. Bleeding Noonan syndrome can cause excessive bleeding and bruising due to clotting defect or having too few platelets. Lymphatic condition Noonan syndrome can cause problem with the lymphatic system, which drain excess fluid from the body and help fight infection. These problems: May show up before or after birth or develop in the teenage year or adulthood Can be focused in a particular area of the body or widespread Most commonly cause excess fluid (lymphedema) on the back of the hand or top of the foot Genital and kidney condition Many people, especially males, with Noonan syndrome can have problem with the genitals and kidneys. Testicles. Undescended testicle (cryptorchidism) are common in males. Puberty. Puberty may be delayed in both boy and girls. Fertility. Most female develop normal fertility. In males, however, fertility may not develop normally, often because of undescended testicles. Kidneys. Kidney problem are generally mild and occur in a fairly small number of people with Noonan syndrome. Skin condition People with Noonan syndrome may have skin conditions, which most commonly are: Various problem that affect the color and texture of the skin Curly, coarse hair or sparse hair When to see a doctor The sign and symptom of Noonan syndrome can be subtle. If you suspect you or your child may have the disorder, see your primary care doctor or your child's pediatrician. You or your child may be referred to a geneticist or a cardiologist. If your unborn child is at risk because of a family history of Noonan syndrome, prenatal test may be available.",687,Noonan Syndrome

"A child who's being abused may feel guilty, ashamed or confused. The child may be afraid to tell anyone about the abuse, especially if the abuser is a parent, other relative or family friend. That's why it's vital to watch for red flags, such as: Withdrawal from friend or usual activity Changes in behavior — such a aggression, anger, hostility or hyperactivity — or change in school performance Depression, anxiety or unusual fears, or a sudden loss of self-confidence Sleep problem and nightmare An apparent lack of supervision Frequent absence from school Rebellious or defiant behavior Self-harm or attempt at suicide Specific sign and symptom depend on the type of abuse and can vary. Keep in mind that warning sign are just that — warning signs. The presence of warning sign doesn't necessarily mean that a child is being abused.

While parent and caregiver often use physical punishment with the intention of helping their child or making their behavior better, research show that spanking is linked with worse, not better, behavior. It's also linked to mental health problems, difficult relationship with parents, lower self-esteem and lower academic performance. Any physical punishment may leave emotional scars. Parental behavior that cause pain, physical injury or emotional trauma — even when done in the name of discipline — could be child abuse.",196,Child Abuse

"Although your body can harbor the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, your immune system usually can prevent you from becoming sick. For this reason, doctor make a distinction between: Latent TB. You have a TB infection, but the bacteria in your body are inactive and cause no symptoms. Latent TB, also called inactive TB or TB infection, isn't contagious. Latent TB can turn into active TB, so treatment is important. Active TB. Also called TB disease, this condition make you sick and, in most cases, can spread to others. It can occur week or year after infection with the TB bacteria. Signs and symptom of active TB include: TB Coughing for three or more week Coughing up blood or mucus Chest pain, or pain with breathing or coughing Unintentional weight loss Fatigue Fever Night sweat Chills Loss of appetite Tuberculosis can also affect other part of your body, including the kidneys, spine or brain.

"The sign of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they become more apparent during the first few month of your baby's life. Signs and severity depend on how many suture are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. Signs and symptom can include: A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the suture are affected Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, with a change in the shape of the head that's not typical Types of craniosynostosis There are several type of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex form of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Multiple suture craniosynostosis is usually linked to genetic syndrome and is called syndromic craniosynostosis. The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what suture are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include: Sagittal (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that run from the front to the back at the top of the skull force the head to grow long and narrow. This head shape is called scaphocephaly. Sagittal craniosynostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Coronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal suture (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also lead to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal suture fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head ha a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward. Metopic. The metopic suture run from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion give the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This head shape is also called trigonocephaly. Lambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which run along the back of the head. It may cause one side of a baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side. Other reason for a misshapen head A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time lying on one side of the head. This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more balanced appearance.",253,Craniosynostosis

PKU Classic PKU. The most severe form of the disorder is called classic PKU. The enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine is missing or severely reduced. This result in high level of phenylalanine that can cause severe brain damage. Less severe form of PKU. In mild or moderate forms, the enzyme still ha some function, so phenylalanine level are not a high, resulting in a smaller risk of significant brain damage. Regardless of the form, most infants, child and adult with the disorder still require a special PKU diet to prevent intellectual disability and other complications. PKU Pregnancy and PKU Women who have PKU and become pregnant are at risk of another form of the condition called maternal PKU. If woman don't follow the special PKU diet before and during pregnancy, blood phenylalanine level can become high and harm the developing baby. PKU PKU PKU Even woman with le severe form of PKU may place their unborn child at risk by not following the PKU diet. PKU PKU Babies born to woman with high phenylalanine level don't often inherit PKU. But a child can have serious problem if the level of phenylalanine is high in the mother's blood during pregnancy. At birth, the baby may have: PKU Low birth weight Unusually small head Problems with the heart In addition, maternal PKU can cause the child to have delayed development, intellectual disability and problem with behavior.",752,Phenylketonuria

This is called early localized disease. A rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spread from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feel warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy. A rash Other stage 1 symptom include: Fever. Headache. Extreme tiredness. Joint stiffness. Muscle ache and pains. Swollen lymph nodes. Stage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse. The symptom often show up within 3 to 10 week after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease. Stage 2 may include the stage 1 symptom and the following: Many rash on other part of the body. Neck pain or stiffness. Muscle weakness on one or both side of the face. Immune-system activity in heart tissue that cause irregular heartbeats. Pain that start from the back and hip and spread to the legs. Pain, numbness or weakness in the hand or feet. Painful swelling in tissue of the eye or eyelid. Immune-system activity in eye nerve that cause pain or vision loss. Stage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptom from the earlier stage and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease. In the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time.

"There are three type of neurofibromatosis, each with different sign and symptoms. Neurofibromatosis 1 Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is usually diagnosed during childhood. Signs are often noticeable at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Signs and symptom are often mild to moderate, but can vary in severity. Signs and symptom include: Flat, light brown spot on the skin (cafe au lait spots). These harmless spot are common in many people. Having more than six cafe au lait spot suggests NF1. They are usually present at birth or appear during the first year of life. After childhood, new spot stop appearing. Freckling in the armpit or groin area. Freckling usually appears by age 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spot and tend to occur in cluster in skin folds. Tiny bump on the iris of the eye (Lisch nodules). These harmless nodule can't easily be seen and don't affect vision. Soft, pea-sized bump on or under the skin (neurofibromas). These benign tumor usually develop in or under the skin, but can also grow inside the body. Sometimes, a growth will involve many nerve (plexiform neurofibroma). Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age. Bone deformities. Abnormal bone development and a deficiency in bone mineral density can cause bone deformity such a a curved spine (scoliosis) or a bowed lower leg. Tumor on the optic nerve (optic glioma). These tumor usually appear by age 3, rarely in late childhood and adolescence, and almost never in adults. Learning disabilities. Impaired thinking skill are common in child who have NF1 but are usually mild. Often there is a specific learning disability, such a a problem with reading or mathematics. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common. Larger than average head size. Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume. Short stature. Children who have NF1 often are below average in height. Neurofibromatosis 2 Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is much le common than NF1. Signs and symptom of NF2 usually result from the development of benign, slow-growing tumor in both ear (acoustic neuromas), which can cause hearing loss. Also known a vestibular schwannomas, these tumor grow on the nerve that carry sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. NF1 NF2 Signs and symptom generally appear during the late teen and early adult years, and can vary in severity. Signs and symptom can include: Gradual hearing loss Ringing in the ear Poor balance Headaches Sometimes NF2 can lead to the growth of schwannomas in other nerves, including the cranial, spinal, visual (optic) and peripheral nerves. People who have NF2 may also develop other benign tumors. NF2 NF2 Signs and symptom of these tumor can include: Numbness and weakness in the arm or leg Pain Balance difficulty Facial drop Vision problem or cataract Seizures Headache Schwannomatosis This rare type of neurofibromatosis usually affect people after age 20. Symptoms usually appear between age 25 and 30. Schwannomatosis cause tumor to develop on the cranial, spinal and peripheral nerve — but rarely on the nerve that carry sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Tumors don't usually grow on both hearing nerves, so people who have schwannomatosis don't experience the same hearing loss a people who have NF2. NF2 Symptoms of schwannomatosis include: Chronic pain, which can occur anywhere in the body and can be disabling Numbness or weakness in various part of the body Loss of muscle",679,Neurofibromatosis

"Gender dysphoria might cause adolescent and adult to experience a marked difference between inner gender identity and assigned gender that last for at least six months. The difference is shown by at least two of the following: A difference between gender identity and genitals or secondary sex characteristics, such a breast size, voice and facial hair. In young adolescents, a difference between gender identity and anticipated secondary sex characteristics. A strong desire to be rid of these genitals or secondary sex characteristics, or a desire to prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics. A strong desire to have the genitals and secondary sex characteristic of another gender. A strong desire to be or to be treated a another gender. A strong belief of having the typical feeling and reaction of another gender.

Gender dysphoria might start in childhood and continue into adolescence and adulthood. Or you might have period in which you no longer experience gender dysphoria. You might also experience gender dysphoria around the time of puberty or much later in life. Complications Gender dysphoria can affect many aspect of life, including daily activities. People experiencing gender dysphoria might have difficulty in school due to pressure to dress in a way that's associated with their sex assigned at birth or out of fear of being harassed or teased. If gender dysphoria impairs the ability to function at school or at work, the result may be school dropout or unemployment. Relationship difficulty are common. Anxiety, depression, self-harm, eating disorders, substance misuse and other problem can occur. People who have gender dysphoria also often experience discrimination, resulting in stress. Accessing health service and mental health service can be difficult due to fear of stigma and a lack of experienced care providers. Adolescents and adult with gender dysphoria without gender-affirming treatment might be at risk of thinking about or attempting suicide.

The lowest part of your spinal cord that remains undamaged after an injury is referred to a the neurological level of your injury. The severity of the injury is often called ""the completeness"" and is classified a either of the following: Complete. If all feeling (sensory) and all ability to control movement (motor function) are lost below the spinal cord injury, your injury is called complete. Incomplete. If you have some motor or sensory function below the affected area, your injury is called incomplete. There are varying degree of incomplete injury. Additionally, paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as: Tetraplegia.

Even though the digestive tract look normal, it doesn't function a it should. Muscles in the intestine move food from the stomach to the rectum. Normally, they contract and relax in a gentle rhythm that move the food along in a fairly predictable schedule. But with some people, the muscle in the intestine spasm. That mean the contraction are longer and stronger than normal. Those spasm are painful. They also disrupt the movement of food through the intestines. If they slow it down, you become constipated. If they cause it to move through too quickly, you get diarrhea. It's not unusual for people to alternate between the two. Another cause of discomfort for people with IBS result from oversensitive nerve ending in the digestive tract. Small bubble of gas that wouldn't bother most people might be quite painful for you. Your heightened sensitivity can also lead to swelling and bloating.",538,Irritable Bowel Syndrome
